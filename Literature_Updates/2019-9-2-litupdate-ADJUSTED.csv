It inhibits phosphate reabsorption and calcitriol production by the kidney. Myelomeningocele (MMC) remains the most severe form of neural tube defects involving serious locomotor disability, osteoporosis and pathologic fractures. We aimed to investigate the influence of vitamin D replacement therapy on serum FGF23 concentration in children with MMC and compare the results with healthy participants. Methods This prospective analysis was conducted on 16 children with MMC and 20 healthy children. Serum FGF23 levels were measured; for the studied group, before and after vitamin D replacement therapy with cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). The children's medical charts were analyzed to determine age, sex, anthropometric measurements, calcium and phosphate, cholecalciferol and renal function parameters. Results There were significant differences in vitamin D and FGF23 serum concentrations between the studied groups. The median vitamin D levels in the MMC group increased during replacement therapy (7 vs. 18.5 ng/mL, p = 0.29) in comparison to the median of 25.5 ng/mL in the control group. In MMC children we found a significant decrease in median serum FGF23 after vitamin D replacement therapy (from 42.1 to 0 RU/mL, p < 0.001). FGF23 correlated positively with albumin, serum and urine phosphate levels and negatively with alkaline phosphatase. Conclusions 1. Serum concentration of FGF-23 is increased in MMC children in comparison to a healthy control group. 2. Vitamin D replacement therapy decreases FGF23 concentrations in MMC children, although further studies are still warranted to gain detailed insight on the FGF23 in the MMC population. 3. Children with MMC present vitamin D deficiency. Nutrition supplemented with low doses of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) (intakes reaching recommended daily allowances) was insufficient to correct 25(OH)-D level in that population of patients."

Recently, it has been reported that an appropriate level of calcium can alleviate fluorosis. However, the appropriate concentration and mechanism of calcium addition is unclear. Hence, we evaluated the histopathology and ultrastructure, DNA fragmentation, hormonal imbalances, biomechanical levels and the expression of apoptosis-related genes, after treating the rats with 150 mg/L NaF and different concentrations of CaCO3. Our results suggested that NaF induced the histopathological and ultrastructural injury, with a concomitant increase in the DNA fragmentation (P<0.05), and serum OC (17.4899±0.8907 pmoL/L) at 120 d. In addition, the qRT-PCR and western blotting results indicated that NaF exposure up-regulated the mRNA and protein expression of Bax, Calpain, Caspase 12, Caspase 9, Caspase 7, Caspase 3, CAD, PARP and AIF while down-regulated the Bcl-2 (P<0.01), decreased the bone ultimate load by 27.15 %, the ultimate stress by 10.07 %, and the ultimate deformity by 23.27 % at 120 d. However, 1 % CaCO3 supplementation decreased the serum OC (14.6559±0.6478 pmoL/L), bone F content (P<0.01), fracture and breakage of collagen fibers, and changed the expression of endoplasmic reticulum pathway related genes and proteins at 120 d. Further 1 % CaCO3 supplementation increased the bone ultimate load by 20.86 %, the ultimate stress by 4.89 %, and the ultimate deformity by 21.57 %. In summary, we conclude that 1 % CaCO3 supplementation alleviated fluoride-induced bone damage by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction."

Seven-week-old female rats were divided into four groups: a sedentary and ad libitum feeding group (n = 10), a jump exercise and ad libitum feeding group (n = 9), a sedentary and 30% food restriction group (n = 9), and a jump exercise and 30% food restriction group (n = 10). The jump groups jumped 20 times/day, 5 times/week. The experiment lasted for 13 weeks. There were no interactions of jump exercise and food restriction on bone. Jump exercise under food restriction conditions induced higher bone strength, bone mineral content, bone area, bone mineral density (BMD), and cortical bone volume in young female rats, similar to rats under ad libitum feeding conditions. Bone strength parameters were not significantly different between ad libitum intake and food restriction with jump exercise training; however, BMD, bone size, and bone mass in the food restriction groups did not reach the levels of those in the ad libitum conditions group with jump exercise training. Neither jump exercise nor food restriction had a significant effect on serum estradiol or IGF-1. Our study reveals jump exercise attenuates loss of biomechanical properties and some bone sites with food restriction in young female rats."

Little is known about the biomolecular release and intrinsic biomechanics of human AAA-SMCs. NO delivery could be an attractive therapeutic strategy to restore lost functionality of AAA-SMCs by inhibiting inflammation and cell stiffening. We aim to establish the differences in phenotype and gene expression of adult human AAA-SMCs from healthy SMCs. Based on our previous study which showed benefits of optimal NO dosage delivered via S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) to healthy aortic SMCs, we tested whether such benefits would occur in AAA-SMCs. The mRNA expression of three genes involved in matrix degradation (ACE, ADAMTS5 and ADAMTS8) was significantly downregulated in AAA-SMCs. Total protein and glycosaminoglycans synthesis were higher in AAA-SMCs than healthy-SMCs (p < 0.05 for AAA-vs. healthy- SMC cultures) and was enhanced by GSNO and 3D cultures (p < 0.05 for 3D vs. 2D cultures; p < 0.05 for GSNO vs. non-GSNO cases). Elastin gene expression, synthesis and deposition, desmosine crosslinker levels, and lysyl oxidase (LOX) functional activity were lower, while cell proliferation, iNOS, LOX and fibrillin-1 gene expressions were higher in AAA-SMCs (p < 0.05 between respective cases), with differential benefits from GSNO exposure. GSNO and 3D cultures reduced MMPs -2, -9, and increased TIMP-1 release in AAA-SMC cultures (p < 0.05 for GSNO vs. non-GSNO cultures). AAA-SMCs were inherently stiffer and had smoother surface than healthy SMCs (p < 0.01 in both cases), but GSNO reduced stiffness (∼25%; p < 0.01) and increased roughness (p < 0.05) of both cell types. In conclusion, exogenously-delivered NO offers an attractive strategy by providing therapeutic benefits to AAA-SMCs."

However, the impact of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) on the aortic-mitral continuity and severity of mitral regurgitation (MR) are poorly understood. In this study, a comprehensive engineering analysis was performed to investigate the impact of TAVR on MR severity and left heart dynamics in a retrospective patient case who harbours bicuspid aortic valve stenosis and concomitant functional MR. The TAVR procedure was computer simulated using a balloon-expandable valve, and the impact of three implantation heights on aortic-mitral coupling, MR severity and device performance were analysed. The accuracy and predictability of the computer modelling framework were validated with pre- and post-operative echo data. The highest deployment model resulted in higher stresses in the native leaflets, contact radial force and stent recoil, while the midway implantation model gave better haemodynamic performance and MR reduction in this patient case. Although the regurgitant volume decreased (less than 10%) for the three deployment configurations, no significant differences in MR severity improvement and mitral leaflet tethering were found. Acute improvement in MR was (i) due to the mechanical compression of the stent against the aortic-mitral curtain, (ii) due to an immediate drop in the ventricular pressure and transmitral pressure gradient. Albeit a single real clinical case, it is our hope that such detailed engineering computational analysis could shed light on the underlying biomechanical mechanisms of TAVR impact on MR."

Clinical interventions may be more effective if such secondary biomechanical changes are effectively addressed. Using a computational model, we simulated these altered soft tissue biomechanical properties to quantify their effects on coordinated finger extension."

This would diminish the chance of dislocation. The goal of this study was to test this idea biomechanically. A linked trapeziometacarpal prosthesis was implanted in seven cadaver hands and combined with three-dimensional printed trapezium cups in 17 different orientations. For every combination, stability of the prosthesis was assessed through its entire passive range of motion. Dorsal inclination of the cup relative to the proximal articular surface increased the risk of dislocation with thumb flexion and opposition. The risk of dislocation was also increased with lateral or medial inclination of the cup exceeding 20°. Our results demonstrate that cup orientation is an important factor in prosthetic joint stability. Cup placement parallel to the proximal articular surface is ideal."

To examine these issues without the complexities of living tissues, we treated cell-free strips of onion epidermal walls with various enzymes and other agents to assess which polysaccharides bear mechanical forces in-plane and out-of-plane of the cell wall. This information is critical for integrating concepts of wall structure, wall material properties, tissue mechanics, and mechanisms of cell growth. With atomic force microscopy we also monitored real-time changes in the wall surface during treatments. Driselase, a potent cocktail of wall-degrading enzymes, removed cellulose microfibrils in superficial lamellae sequentially, layer-by-layer, and softened the wall (reduced its mechanical stiffness), yet did not induce wall loosening (creep). In contrast Cel12A, a bifunctional xyloglucanase/cellulase, induced creep with only subtle changes in wall appearance. Both Driselase and Cel12A increased the tensile compliance, but differently for elastic and plastic components. Homogalacturonan solubilization by pectate lyase and calcium chelation greatly increased the indentation compliance without changing tensile compliances. Acidic buffer induced rapid cell wall creep via endogenous α-expansins, with negligible effects on wall compliances. We conclude that these various wall properties are not tightly coupled and thus reflect distinctive aspects of wall structure. Cross-lamellate networks of cellulose microfibrils influenced creep and tensile stiffness whereas homogalacturonan influenced indentation mechanics. This information is crucial for constructing realistic molecular models that define how wall mechanics and growth depend on primary cell wall structure. This article is protected by copyright.

Details about the manner in which cell wall polymers at the periclinal wall regulate the morphogenetic process in epidermal pavement cells and mechanistic information about the initial steps leading to the characteristic undulations in the cell borders are elusive. Here, we used genetics and recently developed cell mechanical and imaging methods to study the impact of the spatio-temporal dynamics of cellulose and homogalacturonan pectin distribution during lobe formation in the epidermal pavement cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) cotyledons. We show that nonuniform distribution of cellulose microfibrils and demethylated pectin coincides with spatial differences in cell wall stiffness but may intervene at different developmental stages. We also show that lobe period can be reduced when demethyl-esterification of pectins increases under conditions of reduced cellulose crystallinity. Our data suggest that lobe initiation involves a modulation of cell wall stiffness through local enrichment in demethylated pectin, whereas subsequent increase in lobe amplitude is mediated by the stress-induced deposition of aligned cellulose microfibrils. Our results reveal a key role of noncellulosic polymers in the biomechanical regulation of cell morphogenesis."

A randomized crossover design was chosen. The study results imply that the performance and safety potential of a microprocessor-controlled knee joint can be associated with the individual control algorithms and the technological concepts that are implemented to generate motion resistances for controlling flexion and extension movements. When walking with small steps, advantages of the ""default swing"" concept used in the Rheo Knee XC were identified due to a highly reproducible swing phase release. However, when walking backwards, this concept may lead to an uncontrolled knee flexion which partly resulted in falls. When walking down stairs, walking on slopes or while recovering from a stumble after perturbations of the swing phase extension, the C-Leg demonstrated a reliable prosthetic side load-bearing capacity resulting in reduced loading on the residual body. In contrast, the Rheo Knee XC required increased compensatory movements of the remaining locomotor system in order to compensate for reduced load-bearing and safety reserves."

It has been reported that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors promote the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), which is involved in the synthesis of serotonin. However, limited evidence of TPH alteration has been found in selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and more key enzymes need to be investigated. The aim of the present study was to determine whether venlafaxine (VLX; a classical SNRI) regulates TPH and other key enzymes responsible for the synthesis and metabolism of monoaminergic transmitters in rats with chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). The present results suggested that CUS‑exposed rats exhibited decreased locomotor activity in the open‑field test and increased immobility time in the forced swim test, as compared with the controls. Pretreatment with VLX (20 mg/kg) significantly increased locomotor activity and reduced immobility time in the CUS‑exposed rats. In addition, VLX (20 mg/kg) treatment prevented the CUS‑induced reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase and TPH expression in the cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, VLX alleviated the CUS‑induced oxidative stress in the serum, cortex and hippocampus. However, VLX administration did not have an effect on indoleamine‑2,3‑dioxygenase overexpression in the hippocampus. It was therefore concluded that the regulation of abnormalities in the synthesis and metabolism of monoaminergic transmitters may be associated with the antidepressant effects of VLX, suggesting that multimodal pharmacological treatments can efficiently treat depression."

During embryogenesis, neural crest cells undergo coordinated epithelial to mesenchymal transformations and migrate towards various forming organs. Here we develop a computational model to understand how mutual interactions between migrating neural crest cells (NCs) and the surrounding population of placode cells (PCs) generate coordinated migration. According to experimental findings, we implement a minimal set of hypotheses, based on a coupling between chemotactic movement of NCs in response to a placode-secreted chemoattractant (Sdf1) and repulsion induced from contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), triggered by heterotypic NC-PC contacts. This basic set of assumptions is able to semi-quantitatively recapitulate experimental observations of the characteristic multispecies phenomenon of ""chase-and-run"", where the colony of NCs chases an evasive PC aggregate. The model further reproduces a number of in vitro manipulations, including full or partial disruption of NC chemotactic migration and selected mechanisms coordinating the CIL phenomenon. Finally, we provide various predictions based on altering other key components of the model mechanisms."

Arm cycling presumably activates propriospinal networks that modulate Ia presynaptic inhibition. Interlimb pathways are thought to relate to the control of quadrupedal locomotion, allowing for smooth, coordinated movement of the arms and legs. We examined whether the number of active limb pairs affects the amount and duration of activity-dependent plasticity of the SOL H-reflex. On separate days, 14 participants completed 4 randomly ordered 30 min experimental sessions: (1) quiet sitting (CTRL); (2) arm cycling (ARM); (3) leg cycling (LEG); and (4) arm and leg cycling (A&L) on an ergometer. SOL H-reflex and M-wave were evoked via electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve. M-wave and H-reflex recruitment curves were recorded, while the participants sat quietly prior to, 10 and 20 min into, immediately after, and at 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min after each experimental session. Normalized maximal H-reflexes were unchanged in CTRL, but were suppressed by > 30% during the ARM, LEG, and A&L. H-reflex suppression outlasted activity duration for ARM (≤ 2.5 mins), LEG (≤ 5 mins), and A&L (≤ 30 mins). The duration of reflex suppression after A&L was greater than the algebraic summation of ARM and LEG. This non-linear summation suggests that using the arms and legs simultaneously-as in typical locomotor synergies-amplifies networks responsible for the short-term plasticity of lumbar spinal cord excitability. Enhanced activity of spinal networks may have important implications for the implementation of locomotor training for targeted rehabilitation."

Two of these sphingolipidoses, Tay Sachs and Sandhoff diseases, are caused by β-Hexosaminidase (HEXB) enzyme deficiency, resulting in ganglioside (GM2) accumulation and neuronal loss. The precise sequence of cellular events preceding, and leading to, neuropathology remains unclear, but likely involves inflammation and lysosomal accumulation of GM2 in multiple cell types. We aimed to determine the consequences of Hexb activity loss for different brain cell types using zebrafish. Hexb deficient zebrafish (hexb<sup>-/-</sup> ) showed lysosomal abnormalities already early in development both in radial glia, which are the neuronal and glial progenitors, and in microglia. Additionally, at 5 days postfertilization, hexb<sup>-/-</sup> zebrafish showed reduced locomotor activity. Although specific oligosaccharides accumulate in the adult brain, hexb<sup>-/-</sup> ) zebrafish are viable and apparently resistant to Hexb deficiency. In all, we identified cellular consequences of loss of Hexb enzyme activity during embryonic brain development, showing early effects on glia, which possibly underlie the behavioral aberrations. Hereby, we identified clues into the contribution of non-neuronal lysosomal abnormalities in LSDs affecting the brain and provide a tool to further study what underlies the relative resistance to Hexb deficiency in vivo."

The TP tendon decelerates the subtalar joint pronation and internal rotation of the leg during the contact phase. It also plantarflexes and inverts the foot on the leg during the static phase of gait. When this function is lost, the medial longitudinal arch collapses, increasing the length of time of rearfoot pronation, eventually rupturing the TP tendon. Conservative treatment includes immobilization, strapping, antiinflammatories, custom-fabricated orthotics, and physical therapy. If the TP tendon rupture is severe, conservative treatment will provide little relief and surgery is indicated. This case study presents 53-year-old female who presented with left TP tendon rupture with a defect of 6 cm after sustaining an ankle injury that was surgically repaired using a TP tendon fresh frozen allograft and flexor digitorum longus tenodesis. After a 16-month follow-up, the patient was healed without complications and returned to preinjury activity. We believe that surgically repairing a TP tendon rupture with a TP tendon allograft and flexor digitorum longus tenodesis can be 1 of the treatment options for patients with extensive disruption of the TP tendon."

However, the quantitative measurements of pollen adhesion on biological surfaces have been poorly studied so far. We performed atomic force microscopy adhesion measurements of pollen on two most important floral parts for Asteraceae in a course of pollination: the stigma and style of Hypochaeris radicata plant. The results indicated distinct adhesive properties of them-the pollen adhesion on stigmatic surfaces drastically increased over prolonged contact time, while the pollen adhesion increase on stylar surfaces was rather restrained. Based on the observation with cryo-scanning electron microscopy, we explained the experimental results by the presence of morphological features in form of flexible stigmatic papillae that may play a crucial role in enhancing both capillary attraction and van der Waals forces. The distinct adhesive properties seemingly originate from the unique adhesive tasks that each of the floral parts requires to achieve successful pollination. The insights into the adhesive interaction between pollen and the floral parts, obtained in the present study, may lead to better understanding of pollination mechanisms, which are strongly related to our food production. Additionally, the novel pollen adhesive mechanisms learned from the stigma of the studied Asteraceae plant can inspire biomimetic designs of spontaneous gripping systems."

Compared with tissue-derived ECM, cell-derived ECM potentially has more advantages, including less potential for pathogen transfer, fewer inflammatory or anti-host immune responses, and a closer resemblance to the native ECM microenvironment. Different types of cell-derived ECM, such as adipose stem cells, synovium-derived stem cells and bone marrow stromal cells, their effects on articular chondrocytes which have been researched. In this study, we aimed to develop a 3D cell culture substrate using decellularized ECM derived from human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs), and evaluated the effects on articular chondrocytes. We evaluated the morphology and components of hUCMSC-derived ECM using physical and chemical methods. Morphological, histological, immunohistochemical, biochemical, and real-time PCR analyses demonstrated that proliferation and differentiation capacity of chondrocytes using the 3D hUCMSC-derived ECM culture substrate was superior to that using non-coated two-dimensional plastic culture plates. In conclusion, 3D decellularized ECM derived from hUCMSCs offers a tissue-specific microenvironment for in vitro culture of chondrocytes, which not only markedly promoted chondrocyte proliferation but also preserved the differentiation capacity of chondrocytes. Therefore, our findings suggest that a 3D cell-derived ECM microenvironment represents a promising prospect for autologous chondrocyte-based cartilage tissue engineering and regeneration. The hUCMSC-derived ECM as a biomaterial is used for the preparation of scaffold or hybrid scaffold products which need to further study in the future."

Among the six ST8 α-N-acetyl-neuraminide α-2,8-sialyltransferases (ST8SIA) existing in adult brains, ST8SIA2 is a schizophrenia-associated gene. However, the in vivo substrates and physiological functions of most sialyltransferases are currently unknown. The ST8SIA3 is enriched in the striatum. Here, we showed that ablation of St8sia3 in mice (St8sia3-KO) led to fewer disialylated and trisialylated terminal glycotopes in the striatum of St8sia3-KO mice. Moreover, the apparent sizes of several striatum-enriched G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (including the adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor (A<sub>2A</sub>R) and dopamine D<sub>1</sub>/D<sub>2</sub> receptors (D<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>2</sub>R)) were smaller in St8sia3-KO mice than in WT mice. A sialidase treatment removed the differences in the sizes of these molecules between St8sia3-KO and WT mice, confirming the involvement of sialylation. Expression of ST8SIA3 in the striatum of St8sia3-KO mice using adeno-associated viruses normalized the sizes of these proteins, demonstrating a direct role of ST8SIA3. The lack of ST8SIA3-mediated sialylation altered the distribution of these proteins in lipid rafts and the interaction between D<sub>2</sub>R and A<sub>2A</sub>R. Locomotor activity assays revealed altered pharmacological responses of St8sia3-KO mice to drugs targeting these receptors and verified that a greater population of D<sub>2</sub>R formed heteromers with A<sub>2A</sub>R in the striatum of St8sia3-KO mice. Since the A<sub>2A</sub>R-D<sub>2</sub>R heteromer is an important drug target for several basal ganglia diseases (such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease), the present study not only reveals a crucial role for ST8SIA3 in striatal functions but also provides a new drug target for basal ganglia-related diseases."

Peptidergic signaling can involve juxtacrine, paracrine, endocrine, and neuronal signaling, making it difficult to define physiologically important pathways. One of the final steps in the biosynthesis of many neuropeptides requires a single enzyme, peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), and lack of amidation renders most of these peptides biologically inert. PAM, an ancient integral membrane enzyme that traverses the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways, also affects cytoskeletal organization and gene expression. While mice, zebrafish, and flies lacking <i>Pam</i> (<i>Pam<sup>KO/KO</sup></i> ) are not viable, we reasoned that cell type-specific elimination of <i>Pam</i> expression would generate mice that could be screened for physiologically important and tissue-specific deficits. Conditional <i>Pam<sup>cKO/cKO</sup></i> mice, with loxP sites flanking the 2 exons deleted in the global <i>Pam<sup>KO/KO</sup></i> mouse, were indistinguishable from wild-type mice. Eliminating <i>Pam</i> expression in excitatory forebrain neurons reduced anxiety-like behavior, increased locomotor responsiveness to cocaine, and improved thermoregulation in the cold. A number of amidated peptides play essential roles in each of these behaviors. Although atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is not amidated, <i>Pam</i> expression in the atrium exceeds levels in any other tissue. Eliminating <i>Pam</i> expression in cardiomyocytes increased anxiety-like behavior and improved thermoregulation. Atrial and serum levels of ANP fell sharply in PAM myosin heavy chain 6 conditional knockout mice, and RNA sequencing analysis identified changes in gene expression in pathways related to cardiac function. Use of this screening platform should facilitate the development of therapeutic approaches targeted to peptidergic pathways."

Previous studies have shown that, in fatigue failure and damage of cartilage and fibrocartilage, shear loads could be one of the biggest contributors to the failure. The aim of the present study is to develop an evaluation method to study shear properties of the disc and to do a mathematical characterization of it. For the experiments, twelve porcine discs were used. Each disc was dissected from the TMJ and, then, static strain control tests were carried out to obtain the shear relaxation modulus for the central region of the discs. From the results, it was found that the disc presents a viscoelastic behavior under shear loads. Relaxation modulus decreased with time. Shear relaxation was 10% of the instantaneous stress, which implies that the viscous properties of the disc cannot be neglected. The present results lead to a better understanding of the discs mechanical behavior under realistic TMJ working conditions."

Expression of human heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in astrocytes of GFAP.HMOX1 transgenic (TG) mice between 8.5 and 19 months of age results in a parkinsonian phenotype characterized by neural oxidative stress, nigrostriatal hypodopaminergia associated with locomotor incoordination, and overproduction of α-synuclein. We identified two microRNAs (miR-), miR-153 and miR-223, that negatively regulate α-synuclein in the basal ganglia of male and female GFAP.HMOX1 mice. Serum concentrations of both miRNAs progressively declined in the wild-type (WT) and GFAP.HMOX1 mice between 11 and 19 months of age. Moreover, at each time point surveyed, circulating levels of miR-153 were significantly lower in the TG animals compared to WT controls, while α-synuclein protein concentrations were elevated in erythrocytes of the GFAP.HMOX1 mice at 19 months of age relative to WT values. Primary WT neurons co-cultured with GFAP.HMOX1 astrocytes exhibited enhanced protein oxidation, mitophagy and apoptosis, aberrant expression of genes regulating the dopaminergic phenotype, and an imbalance in gene expression profiles governing mitochondrial fission and fusion. Many, but not all, of these neuronal abnormalities were abrogated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of α-synuclein, implicating α-synuclein as a potent, albeit partial, mediator of HO-1's neurodystrophic effects in these parkinsonian mice. Overexpression of HO-1 in stressed astroglia has previously been documented in the substantia nigra of idiopathic PD and may promote α-synuclein production and toxicity by downmodulating miR-153 and/or miR-223 both within the CNS and in peripheral tissues."

During desiccation, the exocarp shrinks and splits open, and subsequent endocarp deformation is a complex three-dimensional shape change, including formation of dehiscence lines, opening of the apical part and formation of a constriction at the middle part. Owing to the constriction forming, mechanical pressure is increasingly applied on the seed until ejection. We describe a structural latch system consisting of connective cellular structures between endocarp and seed, which break with a distinct cracking sound upon ejection. A maximum seed velocity of 12.3 m s<sup>-1</sup>, maximum launch acceleration of 19 853 m s<sup>-2</sup> (approx. 2000g) and maximum seed rotational velocity of 25 714 min<sup>-1</sup> were measured. We argue that miniscule morphological differences between the inner endocarp surface and seed, which features a notable ridge, are responsible for putting spin on the seed. This hypothesis is further corroborated by the observation that there is no preferential seed rotation direction among fruits. Our findings show that H. mollis has evolved similar mechanisms for stabilizing a 'shot out' seed as humans use for stabilizing rifle bullets and are discussed in an ecological (dispersal biology), biomechanical (seed ballistics) and functional-morphological (fine-tuning and morphospace of functional endocarps) contexts, and promising additional aspects for future studies are proposed."

Despite advances in treatments that slow progression and minimize locomotor impairments, its clinical management is still a challenge. Previous preclinical studies, using mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation and isolated physical exercise (EX), reported beneficial results for treatment of PD. Therefore, this experimental randomized study aimed to elucidate the therapeutic potential of combined therapy using adipose-derived human MSCs (ADSCs) grafted into the striatum in conjunction with aerobic treadmill training, specifically in terms of locomotor performance in a unilateral PD rat model induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Forty-one male Wistar rats were categorized into five groups in accordance with the type of treatment to which they were subjected (Sham, 6-OHDA - injury, 6-OHDA + exercise, 6-OHDA + cells, and 6-OHDA + combined). Subsequently, dopaminergic depletion was assessed by the methylphenidate challenge and the specified therapeutic intervention was conducted in each group. The foot fault task was performed at the end of the experiment to serve as an assessment of motor skills. The results showed that despite disturbances in motor balance and coordination, locomotor dysfunction was ameliorated in all treatment categories in comparison to the injury group (sign test, p < 0.001, effect size: 0.71). The exercise alone and combined groups were the categories that exhibited the best recovery in terms of movement performance (p < 0.001). Overall, this study confirms that exercise is a powerful option to improve motor function and a promising adjuvant intervention for stem cell transplantation in the treatment of PD motor symptoms.

Using a Rat Gambling Task, healthy individuals spontaneously making poor decisions (PDMs) were found to co-express a combination of other cognitive and reward-based characteristics similar to symptoms observed in human patients with impulse-control disorders. The main goals of this study were to 1) confirm the existence of PDMs and their unique behavioural phenotypes in Dark Agouti (DA) and Wistar Han (WH) rats, 2) to extend the behavioural profile of the PDMs to probability-based decision-making and social behaviours and 3) to extract key discriminative traits between DA and WH strains, relevant for biomedical research. We have compared cognitive abilities, natural behaviours and physiological responses in DA and WH rats at the strain and at the individual level. Here we found that the naturally occurring PDM's profile was consistent between both rat lines. Then, although the PDM individuals did not take more risks in probability discounting task, they seemed to be of higher social ranks. Finally and despite their similarities in performance, WH and DA lines differed in degree of reward sensitivity, impulsivity, locomotor activity and open space-occupation. The reproducibility and conservation of the complex phenotypes of PDMs and GDMs (good decision makers) in these two genetically different strains support their translational potential. Both strains, present large phenotypic variation in behaviours pertinent for the study of the underlying mechanisms of poor decision making and associated disorders."

Using high-resolution computer tomography (HRCT) each bone element within the skeleton was digitally segmented and a detailed description rendered. Anatomical features related to burrowing include the head having a shovel-like snout with a well-developed horizontal soft tissue ridge, nasal cartilages that exclude sand from the nostrils, reduced eyes covered by a brille, lack of forelimbs, extreme reduction of hindlimbs, and imbricated scales among others. The genus Calyptommatus has unique features such as a triradiate jugal (with digit-like posterior projections), a reduced pectoral girdle and forelimbs, parasternal processes that interconnect the ribs, and a single digit in the hindlimbs. When comparing this species with other gymnophtalmid lizards including, fossorial species, it is clear that Calyptommatus exhibits the highest number of structural modifications within the family. Despite its specialized morphology, it still retains characters that link this genus to other members of Gymnophtalmidae when included in a phylogeny based solely on phenotypic data.

The present work on captive walruses examined the relationship between walrus stereotypies and species-typical foraging behaviors engaged in by their wild counterparts. Two types of walrus stereotypies were studied: (a) patterned swimming around their pool, or (b) repetitive sucking of some item, typically their own flipper. We tested two enrichment devices under filled and empty conditions: large foam/rubber mats and hollow boomer balls, both with multiple holes in them. Both devices were designed to stimulate the use of flippers, vibrissae, and mouth suctioning of small food in the devices. Walruses in the devices with food conditions increased locomotion and device contact and decreased engaging in stereotypies.

In this study, zebrafish embryos were analyzed after 5 and 7 days of exposure to GO (100 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) and HA (20 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) alone or together. The results indicated that, regardless of the presence of HA, larvae exposed to GO for 5 days showed an increase in locomotor activity, reduction in the yolk sac size, and total length and inhibition of AChE activity, but there was no difference in enzyme expression. The statistical analysis indicated that the reductions in total larval length, yolk sac size, and AChE activity in larvae exposed to GO persisted in relation to the control group, but there was a recovery of these parameters in groups also exposed to HA. Larvae exposed to GO for 7 days did not show significant differences in locomotor activity, but the RT-PCR gene expression analysis evidenced an increase in the AChE expression. Since the embryos exposed to GO showed a reduction in overall length, they were submitted to confocal microscopy and their muscle tissue configuration investigated. No changes were observed in the muscle tissue. The results indicated that HA is associated with the toxicity risk modulation by GO and that some compensatory homeostasis mechanisms may be involved in the developmental effects observed in zebrafish."

However, long-term ectopic GDNF delivery is associated with long lasting adverse side effects in PD patients. Therefore, finding safer and effective ways to elevate endogenous GDNF levels is an active area of research. This study underlines the importance of sodium benzoate (NaB), a metabolite of commonly-used spice cinnamon, a food-additive and an FDA-approved drug against hyperammonemia, in stimulating GDNF in primary mouse and human astrocytes. Presence of cAMP response element (CRE) in the Gdnf gene promoter, recruitment of CREB to the Gdnf promoter by NaB and abrogation of NaB-mediated GDNF expression by siRNA knockdown of CREB suggest that NaB induces the transcription of Gdnf via CREB. Finally, oral administration of NaB and cinnamon itself increased the level of GDNF in vivo in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of normal as well as MPTP-intoxicated mice. Accordingly, cinnamon and NaB treatment protected tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons in the SNpc and fibers in the striatum, normalized striatal neurotransmitters, and improved locomotor activities in MPTP-intoxicated Gfap<sup>cre</sup> mice, but not Gdnf<sup>Δastro</sup> mice lacking GDNF in astrocytes. These findings highlight the importance of astroglial GDNF in cinnamon- and NaB-mediated protection of the nigrostriatum in MPTP mouse model of PD and suggest possible therapeutic potential of cinnamon and NaB in PD patients. Graphical abstract Cinnamon metabolite sodium benzoate (NaB) activates cAMP-response element-binding (CREB) via protein kinase A (PKA) in astrocytes. Activated CREB then binds to cAMP-response element (CRE) present in GDNF gene promoter to stimulate the transcription of GDNF in astrocytes. This astrocytic GDNF leads to nigral trophism and protects dopaminergic neurons from MPTP insult."

The efficiency of selective device is mainly estimated by comparing species composition, the biomass and length spectrum of caught individuals and escapees while the functional traits of species are rarely accounted for. Using an innovative technical device to reduce catches of undersized individuals in a multispecific bottom trawl fishery in the Bay of Biscay, namely a T90 mesh cylinder, we measured functional traits on both caught and escaped individuals of 18 species. Using a Principal Component Analysis and K-means partitioning, we clustered species into 6 groups illustrating 6 different locomotion strategies. We identified functional traits related to body size, visual ability and locomotion, differing between caught individuals and escapees using Linear Mixed-effects Models. As expected, escapees were smaller on average but also tended to be more streamlined, with a high position of the eyes and fin features characteristic of manoeuvrability and propulsion. Here, we present how a trait-based approach can shed light on the biological characteristics influencing the efficiency of selective devices."

The animal models studied for antipsychotic-induced weight gain only focused on metabolic alteration in antipsychotics treated animals but none has considered psychosis as a predisposing factor which mimics the clinical condition. The present study was aimed to rule out the impact of pharmacologically induced psychosis-like phenotype on metabolic alterations induced by antipsychotics. Female BALB/c mice (weighing 18-23 g) exhibiting schizophrenia-like behavior after 5 days of MK-801 treatment (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) were administered olanzapine (3 and 6 mg/kg, per oral) and risperidone (2 and 4 mg/kg, per oral) for six weeks. Acute as well as chronic treatment with olanzapine and risperidone treatment significantly reduced locomotion, increased feed intake and body weight in a time-dependent manner, which confirms the face validity of the animal model. Olanzapine (6 mg/kg) treatment significantly altered glucose and lipid homeostasis which was further accompanied by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, ghrelin and leptin. These metabolic and biochemical alterations have demonstrated construct validity. Further, no significant difference was observed in the metabolic parameters in control and schizophrenic mice treated with olanzapine which confers that antipsychotic-induced metabolic alterations are independent of psychosis. Our study concluded that six-week olanzapine (6 mg/kg) treatment in control mice induced most of the clinically relevant physiological, biochemical and metabolic alterations (clinically relevant), that is independent of pharmacologically-induced psychosis."

Mechanical testing was done on segments from ileum and colon in 25 IBS rats and 13 Control rats. Morphometric data were obtained from digitized images of the segments at no-load and zero-stress states. Pressure and diameter changes were measured during flow and ramp distensions under active and passive experimental conditions. Circumferential stresses (force per area) and strains (deformation) were computed with referenced to the zero-stress state. The contraction frequency was analyzed. Contraction thresholds and maximum contraction amplitude were calculated in terms of mechanical stress and strain. Compared with controls, the IBS rats had lower body weight (P < 0.01), smaller colonic opening angle (P < 0.05), higher colonic contraction frequency (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01) and lower contraction thresholds of pressure, stress and strain in both ileum and colon (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). The maximum contraction pressure, stress and strain did not differ between IBS and Control groups (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the pressure, stress, and strain to evoke contractility in ileum and colon were lower whereas the frequency of induced colon contractions was higher in NMD IBS rats compared to normal rats. Furthermore, zero-stress state remodeling occur in colon in NMD IBS rats. Further studies on the association between intestinal biomechanical properties, hypersensitivity and afferent signaling in the IBS animal models are warranted."

Previously, we have shown that a novel ionic co-crystal of lithium salicylate proline (LISPRO) is an improved lithium formulation compared to the carbonate or salicylate form of lithium in terms of safety and efficacy in reducing AD pathology in Alzheimer's mice. The current study is designed to compare the prophylactic effects of LISPRO, lithium carbonate (LC), and lithium salicylate (LS) on cognitive and noncognitive impairments in female transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 AD mice. Female APPswe/PS1dE9 mice at 4 months of age were orally treated with low-dose LISPRO, LS, or LC for 9 months at 2.25 mmol lithium/kg/day followed by determination of body weight, growth of internal organs, and cognitive and noncognitive behavior. No significant differences in body or internal organ weight, anxiety or locomotor activity were found between lithium treated and untreated APPswe/PS1dE9 cohorts. LISPRO, LC, and LS prevented spatial cognitive decline, as determined by Morris water maze and depression as determined by tail suspension test. In addition, LISPRO treatment was superior in preventing associative memory decline determined by contextual fear conditioning and reducing irritability determined by touch escape test in comparison with LC and LS. In conclusion, low-dose LISPRO, LC, and LS treatment prevent spatial cognitive decline and depression-like behavior, while LISPRO prevented hippocampal-dependent associative memory decline and irritability in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice."

Movements of the flukes are actuated by epaxial and hypaxial muscles through caudal tendons inserting onto vertebrate in the peduncle. To determine if the caudal tendons in the peduncle affect the flexibility of the flukes, we must understand how the tendons from axial muscles insert onto the caudal vertebrate. The purpose of this study was to provide a detailed description of the various tendons within the cetacean peduncle with regard to their role in swimming and flexibility. Dissection of the peduncle and flukes of multiple odontocete species showed that there were two distinct epaxial tendon sets within the peduncle: (1) extensor caudae medialis tendon (ECM) and (2) extensor caudae lateralis tendon (ECL). There is one distinct hypaxial tendon set, the medial tendon of the hypaxialis lumborum (MHL). The ECM and MHL tendons inserted serially onto caudal vertebrae while the ECL inserted exclusively onto the terminal vertebrae posterior to the fluke insertion. It is typical that tendons insert onto bone, however, the connection to the core fibrous layer of the flukes suggests an element of active control of the flexibility of the flukes via the axial muscles. Tension from muscular contraction transmitted through the tendons could affect both spanwise and chordwise flexibility. Changing flexibility could modulate thrust and efficiency over an extended operation range of swimming speeds in cetaceans."

TNF-α levels were not different between groups at 24 h. Cortisol levels in the LPS + Quetiapine group were reduced compared to LPS + Placebo (P < 0.001) and did not differ from the placebo group (P = 0.15). Analysis between LPS + Quetiapine and LPS + Placebo treated rats demonstrated improvement in the compound discrimination reversal (CD Rev1) (P = 0.016) and the intra-dimensional reversal (ID Rev2) (P = 0.007) discriminations on trials to criterion. LPS + Quetiapine treated rats had fewer errors than LPS + Placebo treated animals in the compound discrimination (CD) (P = 0.007), CD Rev1 (P = 0.005), ID Rev2 (P < 0.001) discriminations.

Number and morphometry of lipid droplets (LDs) define micro vs macrovesicular steatosis, influence the morphology and function of hepatocytes and possibly their stiffness. The link between grade and features of steatosis and biomechanical properties of single hepatocytes requires deeper investigations. In vitro NAFLD models with distinct steatosis conditions were set by exposing FaO hepatoma cells to single or combined fructose (Fru), fatty acids (FA), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α. Single Cell Force Spectroscopy and Quantitative Phase Microscopy quantified the single cell stiffness and a series of morphometric parameters; the mRNA expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism was quantified by real-time PCR. In our models, LD size and number increased with Fru and FA as single agents, and more with combined Fru/FA (macrovesicular steatosis), while FA/TNFα combination increased LD number with a reduction in their size (microvesicular steatosis). We found that the changes in LD size and number influenced cell stiffness and morphometry as follows: (i) single cell elasticity increased in macrovesicular steatosis (maximally with combined Fru/FA); (ii) FA-induced steatosis resulted in cells thinner and larger, whereas combined FA/TNFα shrunk the hepatocytes. Taken together the data on hepatocyte biomechanics show that, in addition to extent of lipid accumulation, cell stiffness is mainly influenced by LD size, while cell morphometry directly relates to LD number. Our findings suggest that a novel mechanobiology perspective might provide future contributions in NAFLD research."

A total of 598 Jersey and 218 Jersey × Holstein crossbreed cows from 2 commercial dairy herds were enrolled in a retrospective cohort study. Blood samples to determine total Ca concentration were collected from the coccygeal vessels at 3 h 19 min (±2 h 33 min) after calving. We used 2 serum Ca concentration thresholds to define SCH: <2.00 mmol/L (SCH-2.00) and <2.12 mmol/L (SCH-2.12). We evaluated the association of cow-level factors with SCH with multivariable Poisson regression models. Variables evaluated for association with SCH were herd; parity (2, 3, and ≥4); breed; previous lactation length and 305-d mature-equivalent milk yield; previous lactation first test milk yield and last test somatic cell count; lengths of calving interval, gestation, dry, and close-up periods; body condition and locomotion scores at calving; calving ease; and calf sex for singletons. We categorized continuous variables into quartiles (≤25th percentile, interquartile range and ≥75th percentile). The prevalence of SCH among Jersey cows was 40 (SCH-2.00) and 64% (SCH-2.12). Jersey cows of higher parity had greater risk of SCH-2.00 and SCH-2.12. The risk of SCH-2.12 was higher after birthing male calves. We also found a tendency for previous lactation length and previous lactation 305-d mature-equivalent milk yield effect to affect risk of SCH-2.12. The risk of SCH-2.12 was lower for cows that had a previous lactation length shorter than the 25th percentile compared with cows that had a previous lactation length within the interquartile range. The risk of SCH-2.12 was higher for cows that had a previous lactation 305-d mature-equivalent milk yield below the 25th percentile compared with cows that had a previous lactation 305-d mature-equivalent milk yield above the 75th percentile. Also, Jersey × Holstein crossbreed was associated with increased risk of SCH-2.00. In the multivariable analysis, we observed no association between SCH and previous lactation first test milk yield; last test somatic cell count; lengths of calving interval, gestation, dry, and close-up periods; body condition and locomotion scores at calving; and calving ease. Our study identified parity, breed, calf sex, previous lactation length, and previous lactation 305-d mature-equivalent milk yield as cow-level factors associated with SCH in multiparous Jersey cows."

Implant designs have a fundamental role in the initial stability. Although new designs with advanced surface technology have been suggested for the initial stability of implant systems, verification is not simple because of various assessment factors. Our study focused on comparing the initial stability between two different implant systems via design aspects. A simulated model corresponding to the first molar derived from the mandibular bone was constructed. Biomechanical characteristics between the two models were compared by finite element analysis (FEA). Mechanical testing was also performed to derive the maximum loads for the two implant systems. CMI IS-III active (IS-III) had a more desirable stress distribution than CMI IS-II active (IS-II) in the surrounding bone region. Moreover, IS-III decreased the stress transfer to the nerve under the axial loading direction more than IS-II. Changes of implant design did not affect the maximum load. Our analyses suggest that the optimized design (IS-III), which has a bigger bone volume without loss of initial fixation, may minimize the bone damage during fixture insertion and we expect greater effectiveness in older patients."

Two types of prosthetic designs are available for the fully edentulous arch: an implant-supported prosthesis and a tissue-supported prosthesis. The benefit of an implant-supported prosthesis is that residual bony volume is maintained by internal loading of the bone in centric occlusion. With a tissuesupported prosthesis there is absence of internal loading of the alveolus under function, leading to continuous resorption of alveolar bony volume. In treatment planning this group of patients, the differences between the two types of prostheses, as well as the anatomic limitations of the edentulous maxilla and mandible, should be taken into account to enable the optimal choice of number and distribution of implants for proper support of the final prosthesis. This article presents two cases describing an edentulous fixed treatment concept, one a maxillary case and the other a mandibular case."

Current treatments can involve replacing part or all of the degenerate IVDs by invasive surgery. Our vision is to develop a minimally invasive approach in which high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is used to mechanically fractionate degenerate tissue in an IVD; a fine needle is then used to first remove the fractionated tissue and then inject a biomaterial able to restore normal physiologic function. The goal of this manuscript is to demonstrate the feasibility of trans-spinal HIFU delivery using simulations of 3-D ultrasound propagation in models derived from patient computed tomography (CT) scans. The CT data were segmented into bone, fat and other soft tissue for three patients. Ultrasound arrays were placed around the waist of each patient model, and time-reversal was used to determine the source signals necessary to create a focus in the center of the disc. The simulations showed that for 0.5 MHz ultrasound, a focus could be created in most of the lumbar IVDs, with the pressure focal gain ranging from 3.2-13.7. In conclusion, it is shown that with patient-specific planning, focusing ultrasound into an IVD is possible in the majority of patients despite the complex acoustic path introduced by the bony structures of the spine."

However, little is known about the developmental bases of these differences, posing a challenge when interpreting the morphology of juvenile hominins. In this study, we investigated ontogenetic variation in the thoracolumbar transition of juvenile and adult great apes, humans, and fossils attributed to Australopithecus and early Pleistocene Homo erectus. For each vertebra involved in the transition, we quantified functionally relevant aspects of zygapophyseal form: facet curvature in the transverse plane, facet orientation relative to midline, and the shift in these variables across the thoracolumbar transition, from the antepenultimate rib-bearing thoracic to the first lumbar vertebra (L1). Among extant hominids, adult individuals of Pan and Homo exhibit a greater shift in facet morphology across the thoracolumbar transition in comparison to Gorilla and Pongo. This pattern is driven by interspecific differences in the L1 facets, with those of chimpanzees and humans being more curved and more sagittally oriented. Chimpanzees and humans also experience more change in facet morphology during development relative to gorillas and orangutans. Humans differ from chimpanzees in achieving their adultlike configuration much earlier in development. The fossil specimens indicate that early hominins had adult morphologies that were similar to those of extant Homo and Pan, and that they achieved their adult morphologies early in development, like extant humans. Although it is unclear why adult chimpanzees and hominins share an adult morphology, we speculate that the early acquisition of adultlike L1 zygapophyseal morphology in hominins is an evolutionary novelty related to conferring stability to a relatively long lumbar spine as young individuals are learning to walk bipedally."

Therefore, delivering existing therapeutic agents to the central nervous system is expected to provide benefits in various diseases. In this study, we investigated whether inhaled central nervous system drugs reached the brain and affected mouse behaviour. Dizocilpine (MK-801), which increases locomotor activity in mice, was mainly used to study this hypothesis. First, we administered MK-801, an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, to mice via inhalation and examined whether it induced excessive activity similar to that observed after intraperitoneal administration. We also examined the time- and dose-dependency of drug induced changes in mouse behaviour after MK-801 inhalation. Next, we investigated whether inhalation of scopolamine, pentobarbital, and imipramine also affected mouse behaviour. Mice that inhaled MK-801 showed MK-801-induced hyperactivity similar to that observed following intraperitoneal administration. Furthermore, the extent of activity changed in a time- and dose-dependent manner after MK-801 inhalation. Inhalation of pentobarbital, scopolamine, and imipramine also changed mouse behaviour. These results demonstrate that inhalation of MK-801 exerts effects similar to those achieved with intraperitoneal and oral administration in mice. Thus, central nervous system agonists can reach the brain efficiently via inhalation. This finding may facilitate the development of improved therapies for brain disorders."

However, a computational framework capturing all of the dominant changes in the multiphasic parameters has not yet been developed. This article proposes a new finite element model of the bone-cartilage unit by combining several validated, nonlinear, depth-dependent, fibril-reinforced, and swelling models, which can computationally simulate the variations in the dominant parameters during osteoarthritis degeneration by indentation and unconfined compression tests. The mentioned dominant parameters include the proteoglycan depletion, collagen fibrillar softening, permeability, and fluid fraction increase for approximately non-advanced osteoarthritis. The results depict the importance of subchondral bone tissues in fluid distribution within the bone-cartilage units by decreasing the fluid permeation and pressure (up to a maximum of 100 kPa) during osteoarthritis, supporting the notion that subchondral bones might play a role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Furthermore, the osteoarthritis composition-based studies shed light on the significant biomechanical role of the calcified cartilage, which experienced a maximum change of 70 kPa in stress, together with relative load contributions of articular cartilage constituents during osteoarthritis, in which the osmotic pressure bore around 70% of the loads after degeneration. To conclude, the new insights provided by the results reveal the significance of the multiphasic osteoarthritis simulation and demonstrate the functionality of the proposed bone-cartilage unit model."

Additionally, scholars have focused on physical intensity of movement using biomechanics, evaluated burials of known occupation, and used complex statistical methods to help interpret skeletal changes associated with these conditions. This article also narrows to focus on these conditions within thematic ""small data"" areas throughout the Andes. This research concludes with describing future directions to understand skeletal changes, such as more multidisciplinary studies between osteologists and pathologists, collaborations with living people to collect CT, x-rays, or computer-aided motion capture, and a stronger focus on how these conditions correlate with intense biomechanical changes in younger individuals."

Modifications to the composite profile of the rostral cuticle that simultaneously enhance the flexibility and toughness of the distal portion of the snout are characterized. Using classical laminate plate theory, the effect of these modifications on the elastic behavior of the exoskeleton is estimated. It is shown that the tensile behavior of the rostrum across six Curculio species with high morphological variation correlates with changes in the relative layer thicknesses and orientation angles of layers in the exoskeleton. Accordingly, increased endocuticle thickness is strongly correlated with increased tensile strength. Rostrum stiffness is shown to be inversely correlated with work of fracture; thus allowing a highly curved rostrum to completely straighten without structural damage. Finally, exocuticle rich invaginations of the occipital sutures are identified both as a likely site of crack initiation in tensile failure and as a source of morphological constraint on the evolution of the rostrum in Curculio weevils. It is concluded that avoidance of catastrophic structural failure, as initiated in these sutures under tension, is the driving selective pressure in the evolution of the female Curculio rostrum."

The ultrastructure of this layer without interference from the underlying cartilage was independently investigated using confocal, second harmonic generation and atomic force microscopy.

LAY DESCRIPTION: The chronic pain and dysfuction in synovial joints caused by osteoarthritis can have a debilitating impact on daily activities for sufferers. Osteoarthritis is characterised by the deterioration of the articular cartilage. Despite intensive research, the wear mechanism of articular cartilage and the progression of osteoarthritis remain unclear in the literature. Articular cartilage is a resilient tissue that provides a low friction surface to facilitate painless locomotion. The surface of articular cartilage plays a crucial role in attenuating and transmitting mechanical loads. Disruption at the surface of articular cartilage causes changes to its frictional properties, instigating the deterioration of the tissue. Despite this, the definition of the most superficial layer of articular cartilage, as well as its composition and microstructure, have endured a long history of debate, clouding our understanding of the early progression of osteoarthritis. In order to investigate the surface of articular cartilage independently from the underlying cartilage, we physically peeled a transparent membrane of 20.0 ± 4.7 µm thickness, the most superficial layer, from the central loading region of the femoral condyles of sheep. Using confocal, second harmonic generation and atomic force microscopy, we found that the most superficial layer contains cartilage cells (chondrocytes), densely packed collagen, coarse elastic fibres and a fine elastic network. The coarse elastic fibres are most prevalent at the surface of the layer where collagen and chondrocyte densities are lowest. Furthermore, we investigated the surfaces at the interface of the most superficial layer with the underlying articular cartilage. At the interface of this most superficial layer with the underlying bulk cartilage, a dense fibrillar network exists, formed mainly by collagen fibrils and elastin microfibrils. In contrast, the interface of the underlying cartilage with the most superficial layer contains collagen fibrils, fine microfibrils and microfibrils distinctively laced on one side. The findings of this study have confirmed that there is a most superficial layer that is able to be removed using a tangential force. Through the application of advanced imaging technologies, we have shown that this most superficial layer is cellular and have detailed its composition and ultrastructure. Due to the close association between the form and function of tissues, the findings of this study will play an important role in understanding the mechanical function and wear mechanism of articular cartilage. This may lead to the development of more promising tissue engineering techniques to treat cartilage defects and osteoarthritis."

However, these tools, in the context of pediatric head injury, have yet to be validated due to a paucity of pediatric head response data. The goal of this study is to investigate the response and injury tolerance of the pediatric head to impact. Twelve pediatric heads were impacted in a series of drop tests. The heads were dropped onto five impact locations (forehead, occiput, vertex and right and left parietal) from drop heights of 15 and 30 cm. The head could freely fall without rotation onto a flat 19 mm thick platen. The impact force was measured using a 3-axis piezoelectric load cell attached to the platen. Age and drop height were found to be significant factors in the impact response of the pediatric head. The head acceleration (14%-15 cm; 103-30 cm), Head Injury Criterion (HIC) (253%-15 cm; 154%-30 cm) and impact stiffness (5800%-15 cm; 3755%-30 cm) when averaged across all impact locations increased with age from 33 weeks gestation to 16 years, while the pulse duration (66%-15 cm; 53%-30 cm) decreased with age. Increases in head acceleration, HIC and impact stiffness were also observed with increased drop height, while pulse duration decreased with increased drop height. One important observation was that three of the four cadaveric heads between the ages of 5-months and 22-months sustained fractures from the 15 cm and 30 cm drop heights. The 5-month-old sustained a right parietal linear fracture while the 11- and 22-month-old sustained diastatic linear fractures."

While numerous walking simulations and robots have been constructed, no full-state walking controller for even a simple model of walking has been derived from human walking data. Here, to construct such a feedback controller, we applied thousands of unforeseen perturbations to subjects walking on a treadmill and collected data describing their recovery to normal walking. Using these data, we derived a linear controller to make the classical inverted pendulum model of walking respond to perturbations like a human. The walking model consists of a point-mass with two massless legs and can be controlled only through the appropriate placement of the foot and the push-off impulse applied along the trailing leg. We derived how this foot placement and push-off impulse are modulated in response to upper-body perturbations in various directions. This feedback-controlled biped recovers from perturbations in a manner qualitatively similar to human recovery. The biped can recover from perturbations over twenty times larger than deviations experienced during normal walking and the biped's stability is robust to uncertainties, specifically, large changes in body and feedback parameters."

Multi-segment foot kinematics of 12 students were assessed while running barefoot at 3.3 m/s (±10%) using a passive optoelectronic motion analysis system. Participants performed multiple running trials while landing on the rearfoot and midfoot. Comparison of the kinematic waveforms was performed using one-dimensional statistical parametric mapping (1DSPM) (paired <i>t</i>-test). The inter-segment angle between the shank and calcaneus was found to be significantly more plantar-flexed, more inverted and more adducted in the midfoot striking (MFS) condition compared to the RFS pattern. The calcaneus-midfoot inter-segment angle was found to be more plantar-flexed in the MFS condition. The downward angulation of the metatarsals and the medial longitudinal arch angle in the late swing phase was found to be more pronounced during MFS. Differences between midfoot and RFS patterns occur in the first sub-phase of stance (0-50% of the stance phase).

However, this procedure involves the risk of a higher complication rate. In order to reduce the occurrence of re-ruptures and pathological tendon extensions, a tendon reconstruction with the highest possible primary stability is desirable. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if augmentation using synthetic polyester tapes (QuadsTape™) could provide greater primary stability in case of different tendon suture techniques. 90 tendons of the superficial toe flexor of pigs were divided into 9 groups. The reconstruction method was combined using the factors suture technique (Kessler and Bunnell), augmentation (non-augmented and augmented with QuadsTape™) and defect type (end-to-end and 10 mm gap). The biomechanical measurements were performed on a material testing machine and consisted of a creep test, a cyclic test and a tear-off test. This study compared creep strain, ultimate load failure, maximum stress and stiffness. Irrespective of the type of defect involved, augmentation of the tendon sutures led to a significant increase of the maximum force (not augmented: 82.30 ± 25.48 N, augmented: 135.73 ± 30.69 N, p < 0.001) and the maximum stress (not augmented: 2.26 ± 0.83 MPa, augmented: 4.13 ± 1.79 MPa, p < 0.001). Furthermore, there was a non-significant increase in stiffness and no significant differences were observed with respect to creep strain. Augmentation of Achilles tendon reconstruction using QuadsTape™ increases composite strength and stiffness in the in vitro model, thus potentially contributing to the feasibility of early rehabilitation programs.

However, the coordination between gaze and stride is not well understood. We examined the coordination of gaze shifts, fixations, constant gaze, and slow gaze with strides in cats walking on different surfaces. We found that gaze behaviors are coordinated with strides even when walking on a flat surface in the complete darkness, occurring in a sequential order during different phases of the stride. During walking on complex surfaces gaze behaviors are typically tighter coordinated with strides, particularly at faster speeds, only slightly shifting in phase. These findings indicate that the coordination of gaze behaviors with strides is not vision-driven, but is a part of the whole body locomotion synergy; the visual environment and locomotor task modulate it. The results may be relevant to developing diagnostic tools and rehabilitation approaches for patients with locomotor deficits."

In the present work, we investigated the effect of an organophosphate pesticide, i.e., malathion, administrated peri- and postnatally on the antioxidant system as well as on acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity in the brains of mice pups during the three postnatal weeks. Furthermore, we analyzed the behavior of the offspring just after weaning to assess the eventual effect of the pesticide on anxiety traits and social interaction. Concerning the biochemical biomarkers, the continuous treatment with malathion given either at a low dose of 5 mg/kg or at a medium one, 15 mg/kg, causes alterations in the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase, and glutathione peroxidase, accompanied by high level of peroxidation of membrane lipids, indicating a disturbance in intracellular redox homeostasis with subsequent increased intracellular oxidative stress. The effect was more pronounced when the high dose was applied. This was also demonstrated for the activity of AChE, downregulated at all postnatal ages investigated (5, 15, and 21), whereas the low dose (5 mg/kg) did not alter this enzymatic activity which is in line with the absence of locomotor activity alteration as assessed by open field (OF). With regard to this last test, results obtained show also that the treated offspring mice develop an anxiogenic state as evidenced by open field as well as an impairment of social interaction. Altogether, these results provide an accurate characterization of the association between neurobehavioral outcomes and brain alterations following malathion administrated in gestational and lactational periods, even given at low dose, classified as safe, and indicate clearly that the developing brain is sensitively vulnerable to this organophosphate pesticide."

Current rTSA testing standards rely upon synthetic bone surrogates, but it is unclear if these models accurately recapitulate the mechanics of osteoporotic bone. Additionally, it also unknown if the use of a central screw effectively provides resistance to micromotion in the milieu of poor quality bone. The purpose of this experiment was to create a novel cyclic load test protocol that elicited clinically relevant failures, so that comparisons of relative motion between baseplates and bones could be made with: (1) synthetic bones and poor quality cadaveric bones, and (2) the use or omission of a central screw. rTSA components were implanted into cadaveric and synthetic bones with and without a central screw. To model a range of loads that may be experienced during abduction, increasing cyclic loads were applied to shoulder joints in 30° of humeral abduction. Cycles and loads prior to permanent deformation exceeding 150 µm, 1 mm, and joint failure were determined using measurements from the test frame and from 3-D motion analysis. Synthetic bones demonstrated significantly more resistance to micromotion in comparison to cadaveric bones. Use of the central screw improved resistance to dislodgement, which was only observed in the cadaveric specimens. This study highlights the need for biomechanical testing with cadaveric specimens, especially when assessing osteopenic or osteoporotic populations."

Patients present with recurrent effusions, subjective instability (especially going downstairs), quadriceps weakness, and diffuse periretinacular pain. Manual testing for laxity in flexion is commonly done to confirm a diagnosis, although testing positions and laxity grades are inconsistent. Nonsurgical treatment includes quadriceps strengthening and bracing treatment. The mainstays to surgical management of femoral instability involve increasing the posterior condylar offset, decreasing the tibial slope, raising the joint line in combination with a thicker polyethylene insert, and ensuring appropriate rotation of implants. Patient outcomes after revision TKA for flexion instability show the least amount of improvement when compared with revisions for other TKA failure etiologies. Future work is needed to unify reproducible diagnostic criteria. Advancements in biomechanical analysis with motion detection, isokinetic quadriceps strength testing, and computational modeling are needed to advance the collective understanding of this underappreciated failure mechanism."

MPD acts on the reward/motive and motor circuits of the CNS to produce its effects on behavior. The caudate nucleus (CN) is known to be a part of these circuits, so a lesion study was designed to elucidate the role of the CN in response to acute and chronic MPD exposure. Five groups of n = 8 rats were used: control, sham CN lesions, non-specific electrolytic CN lesions, dopaminergic-specific (6-OHDA toxin) CN lesion, and glutaminergic-specific (ibotenic acid toxin) CN lesions. On experimental day (ED) 1, all groups received saline injections. On ED 2, surgeries took place, followed by a 5-day recovery period (ED 3-7). Groups then received six daily MPD 2.5 mg/kg injections (ED 9-14), then three days of washout with no injection (ED 15-17), followed by a re-challenge with the previous 2.5 mg/kg MPD dose (ED 18). Locomotive activity was recorded for 60 min after each injection by a computerized animal activity monitor. The electrolytic CN lesion group responded to the MPD acute and chronic exposures similarly to the control and sham groups, showing an increase in locomotive activity, i.e. sensitization. The dopaminergic-specific CN lesion group failed to respond to MPD exposure both acute and chronically. The glutaminergic-specific CN lesion group responded to MPD exposure acutely but failed to manifest chronic effects. This confirms the CN's dopaminergic system is necessary for MPD to manifest its acute and chronic effects on behavior, and demonstrates that the CN's glutaminergic system is necessary for the chronic effects of MPD such as sensitization. Thus, the dopaminergic and glutaminergic components of the CN play a significant role in differentially modulating the acute and chronic effects of MPD respectively."

Twelve male collegiate students (heel-strikers) performed walking at 1.5 m/s, jogging at 2.5 m/s, and running at 3.5 m/s. A custom-made sliding platform was used to provide the different shear cushion conditions. The shear cushion conditions were fixed (a fixed platform; control group), stiff (K = 2746 N/m), medium stiff (K = 2256 N/m), medium soft (K = 1667 N/m), and soft (K = 1079 N/m). The results showed that all cushion conditions produced sliding displacement and delayed the TPPSF during walking, jogging, and running compared with fixed condition. The APLR and MPLR were lowest under medium soft condition during walking, while the PPSF was similar between medium soft and soft conditions. For jogging and running, the PPSF as well as APLR and MPLR were the lowest under medium stiff condition except the maximum PLR was similar among stiff, medium stiff, and medium soft conditions during running. In conclusion, shear cushion produces appropriate sliding displacement and effectively delays the TPPSF to provide the musculoskeletal system additional time to absorb the impact and reduce loading. The present study demonstrates optimal stiffness of shear cushion at different traveling speeds and suggests that a shear cushion system can be applied in future designs of cushion structures."

In conclusion, results indicated corneal strengthening with both protocols especially with the 9 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. Corvis ST indices can provide ""in vivo"" biomechanical evidence on the efficacy of CXL that may occur prior to clinical indices."

As a biomarker to detect FOG, the Freeze index (FI), which is defined as the ratio of the areas under power spectra in 'freeze' band and in 'locomotion' band, can negatively be affected by poor time and frequency resolution of time-frequency spectrum estimate when short-time Fourier transform (STFT) or Wavelet transform (WT) is used. In this study, a novel high-resolution parametric time-frequency spectral estimation method is proposed to improve the accuracy of FI. A time-varying autoregressive moving average model (TV-ARMA) is first identified where the time-varying parameters are estimated using an asymmetric basis function expansion method. The TV-ARMA model is then transformed into frequency domain to estimate the time-frequency spectrum and calculate the FI. Results evaluated on the Daphnet Freezing of Gait Dataset show that the new method improves the time and frequency resolutions of the time-frequency spectrum and the associate FI has better performance in the detection of FOG than its counterparts based on STFT and WT methods do. Moreover, FOGs can be predicted in advance of its occurrence in most cases using the new method."

We know from clinical experience that malrotation of surgical nasoseptal cartilage grafts can lead to increased graft absorption. Other studies have also suggested directionally dependent compressive stiffness suggesting anisotropy, but morphological investigations are lacking. This study characterizes immature and mature native bovine nasoseptal cartilage using a combination of immunohistochemistry, biomechanical testing and structural imaging. Our findings indicate that there is extensive postnatal synthesis and reorganization of the extracellular matrix in bovine nasoseptal cartilage, independent of joint loading forces responsible for articular cartilage anisotropy. Immature nasoseptal cartilage is more cellular and homogenous compared to the zonal organization of cells and extracellular matrix of mature cartilage. Mature samples also exhibited greater glycosaminoglycan content and type II collagen fibre alignment compared to immature cartilage and this correlates with greater compressive stiffness. Engineered neocartilage often consists of immature, isotropic, homogenous tissue that is unable to meet the functional and mechanical demands when implanted into the native environment. This study demonstrates the importance of anisotropy on biomechanical tissue strength to guide future cartilage tissue engineering strategies for surgical reconstruction."

Particularly intraarticular ligaments, which connect the articulating bones such as the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscotibial ligaments, fixing the fibrocartilaginous menisci to the tibial bone, are prone to the inflamed joint milieu in OA. However, the pathogenesis of ligament degeneration on the cellular level, most likely triggered by OA associated inflammation, remains poorly understood. Hence, this review sheds light into the intimate interrelation between ligament degeneration, synovitis, joint cartilage degradation, and dysbalanced subchondral bone remodeling. Various features of ligament degeneration accompanying joint cartilage degradation have been reported including chondroid metaplasia, cyst formation, heterotopic ossification, and mucoid and fatty degenerations. The entheses of ligaments, fixing ligaments to the subchondral bone, possibly influence the localization of subchondral bone lesions. The transforming growth factor (TGF)β/bone morphogenetic (BMP) pathway could present a link between degeneration of the osteochondral unit and ligaments with misrouted stem cell differentiation as one likely reason for ligament degeneration, but less studied pathways such as complement activation could also contribute to inflammation. Facilitation of OA progression by changed biomechanics of degenerated ligaments should be addressed in more detail in the future."

In this study we focused on the layered structure of the colorectum through the wall thickness and determined the biomechanical properties of layer-separated colorectal tissue. We harvested the distal 30 mm of mouse colorectum and dissected this tissue into inner and outer composite layers. The inner composite consists of the mucosa and submucosa, whereas the outer composite includes the muscular layers and serosa. We divided each composite axially into three 10-mm-long segments and conducted biaxial mechanical extension tests and opening-angle measurements for each tissue segment. In addition, we quantified the thickness of the rich collagen network in the submucosa by nonlinear imaging via second-harmonic generation (SHG). Our results reveal that the inner composite is slightly stiffer in the axial direction, whereas the outer composite is stiffer circumferentially. The stiffness of the inner composite in the axial direction is about twice that in the circumferential direction, consistent with the orientations of collagen fibers in the submucosa approximately ±30° to the axial direction. Submucosal thickness measured by SHG showed no difference from proximal to distal colorectum under the load-free condition, which likely contributes to the comparable tension stiffness of the inner composite along the colorectum. This, in turn, strongly indicates the submucosa as the load-bearing structure of the colorectum. This further implies nociceptive roles for the colorectal afferent endings in the submucosa, which likely encode tissue-injurious mechanical distension.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Visceral pain from distal colon and rectum (colorectum) is usually elicited from mechanical distension/stretch, rather than from heating, cutting, or pinching, which usually evoke pain from the skin. We conducted layer-separated biomechanical tests on mouse colorectum and identified an unexpected role of submucosa as the load-bearing structure of the colorectum. Outcomes of this study will focus attention on sensory nerve endings in the submucosa that likely encode tissue-injurious distension/stretch to cause visceral pain."

We created an activity for high school students that required them to integrate biology and physics concepts to experience how humans and animals maneuver through their environments (i.e., turning). Understanding how turning works is important because it accounts for up to 50% of daily walking steps and is needed for survival when animals elude predators and capture prey. For this activity, student groups used 2 × 4 lumber, wood screws, and a power drill to build an apparatus that, when connected to the body, altered rotational inertia (object's resistance to change in angular motion, <i>I</i> = mass × radius<sup>2</sup>). Students navigated through a slalom course with the apparatus (increased radius and rotational inertia) and without the apparatus (mass-matched control). Times to complete the course were compared between trials to determine the influence of rotational inertia on turning performance. Students compiled their data, graphed their results, and found that increased rotational inertia decreased turning performance. Results were connected to sports, rehabilitation, and dinosaur evolution. This activity was implemented during local, regional, national, and international outreach events and adapted for use in undergraduate courses as well (total impact, 250 students). At the end of the activity, students were able to <i>1</i>) describe whether their results supported their hypothesis; <i>2</i>) explain how radius influences rotational inertia and turning performance; and <i>3</i>) apply results to real-world examples.

The current paradigm of osteoarthritis is evolving from a purely mechanical disease caused by cartilage wear towards a complex biological response connecting biomechanics, inflammation, and the immune system. The view of osteoarthritis as a chronic wound highlights the role inflammation plays and also the body's attempts to repair an ongoing injury. Inflammatory signals, including cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tissue necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), surface-expressed pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as toll-like receptors 2 and 4, complement factors such as C5, as well as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) drive the enzymatic cascade that degrades cartilage matrix in OA. Considering the joint as an entire organ, interactions between the cells that reside in the synovium including macrophages and other immune cells, appear to drive enzymatic activity in cartilage, which in turn feeds signals back to the synovium that continue stimulating degradation in a feed forward loop. This review will explore the potential roles of immune cells such as macrophages and T cells in the synovium in both stimulating and modulating the inflammatory response in osteoarthritis.

Emerging methods range from data-driven approaches to biomechanical model-based methods. However, there has been no direct comparison between these two types of continuous EMG-based interfaces. The aim of this study was to compare a musculoskeletal model (MM) with two data-driven approaches, linear regression (LR) and artificial neural network (ANN), for predicting continuous wrist and hand motions for EMG-based interfaces. Six able-bodied subjects and one transradial amputee subject performed (missing) metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and wrist flexion/extension, simultaneously or independently, while four EMG signals were recorded from forearm muscles. To add variation to the EMG signals, the subjects repeated the MCP and wrist motions at various upper extremity postures. For each subject, the EMG signals collected from the neutral posture were used to build the EMG interfaces; the EMG signals collected from all postures were used to evaluate the interfaces. The performance of the interface was quantified by Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) and the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) between measured and estimated joint angles. The results demonstrated that the MM predicted movements more accurately, with higher r values and lower NRMSE, than either LR or ANN. Similar results were observed in the transradial amputee. Additionally, the variation in r across postures, an indicator of reliability against posture changes, was significantly lower (better) for the MM than for either LR or ANN. Our findings suggest that incorporating musculoskeletal knowledge into EMG-based human-machine interfaces could improve the estimation of continuous, coordinated motion."

Kinematic data of elbow flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination was acquired using optical motion capture from 12 healthy male volunteers. Segment coordinate systems for humerus, forearm, radius, ulna, and hand were defined. Different tracking methods, using anatomical markers or rigid or point maker clusters, were used to compute the three-dimensional rotations. Marker placement errors were assessed to evaluate the rigid body assumption. Multiple comparisons demonstrated statistical differences between tracking methods: compared to using only anatomical markers, tracking using clusters reduced the estimated range of pronation/supination by 14.9%-43.2%, while it estimated increased flexion/extension by 5.3%-9.1%. The study suggests using only anatomical markers exerts the optimal estimation of elbow and forearm kinematics. Modelling using the coordinate systems of the humerus and forearm and of the humerus and ulna, respectively, demonstrated good consistency with literature and are correspondingly regarded as the most appropriate approach for measuring pronation/supination and flexion/extension. The results are valuable in establishing a measurement protocol for analysing elbow and forearm kinematics, avoiding confusions and misinterpretations in communicating results from different methodologies."

Eight young subjects were asked to manage tripping events while walking on a treadmill. An adaptive threshold-based algorithm, relying on a pool of adaptive oscillators, was tuned to identify abrupt kinematics modifications during tripping. Inputs of the algorithm were the elevation angles of lower limb segments, as estimated by IMUs located on thighs, shanks and feet. The results showed that the proposed algorithm can identify a lack of balance in about 0.37 ± 0.11 s after the onset of the perturbation, with a low percentage of false alarms (<10%), by using only data related to the perturbed shank. The proposed algorithm can hence be considered a multi-purpose tool to identify different perturbations (i.e., slippage and tripping). In this respect, it can be implemented for different wearable applications (e.g., smart garments or wearable robots) and adopted during daily life activities to enable on-demand injury prevention systems prior to fall impacts."

Several studies have investigated dynamic stability of locomotion using wearable accelerometer measurements. However, no study has reviewed how dynamic stability of locomotion is quantified using accelerometry. Therefore, the present review aims to synthetise the methods and findings of studies investigating stability related parameters measured by accelerometry, during locomotion on various surfaces, and among asymptomatic participants. A systematic search of studies associated with locomotion was conducted. Only studies including assessment of dynamic stability parameters based on accelerometry, including at least one group of asymptomatic participants, and conditions that occur during trail running were considered relevant for this review. Consequently, all retrieved studies used a non-obstructive portable accelerometer or an inertial measurement unit. Fifteen studies used a single tri-axial accelerometer placed above the lumbar region allowing outdoor recordings. From trunk accelerations, a combination of index of cycle repeatability and signal dispersion can adequately be used to assess dynamic stability. However, as most studies included indoor conditions, studies addressing the biomechanics of trail running in outdoor conditions are warranted."

The present study proposes an approach for automatically recognize all stroke phases through three-dimensional (3D) wrist's trajectory estimated using inertial devices. Inertial data of 14 national-level male swimmer were collected while they performed 25 m front-crawl trial at intensity range from 75% to 100% of their 25 m maximal velocity. The 3D coordinates of the wrist were computed using the inertial sensors orientation and considering the kinematic chain of the upper arm biomechanical model. An algorithm that automatically estimates the duration of entry, pull, push, and recovery phases result from the 3D wrist's trajectory was tested using the bi-dimensional (2D) video-based systems as temporal reference system. A very large correlation (r = 0.87), low bias (0.8%), and reasonable Root Mean Square error (2.9%) for the stroke phases duration were observed using inertial devices versus 2D video-based system methods. The 95% limits of agreement (LoA) for each stroke phase duration were always lower than 7.7% of cycle duration.

The swimmer's velocity and arm coordination model do not affect the performance of the algorithm in stroke phases detection.

This has raised awareness that conventional techniques may not aim for the correct component orientation target, and the lumbo-pelvic kinematics, which influences the functional acetabular orientation, may be of interest to further improve THA clinical outcomes. This has led to the development of the Lumbo-Pelvic kinematic alignment (KA) technique for THA that aims to anatomically position and kinematically align hip implants (acetabular and femoral, total and resurfacing components), in order to optimise prosthetic hip biomechanics and hopefully improve prosthetic function, patient satisfaction, and components' lifespan.

Failures are mainly due to the mechanical mismatch of commercial implants with respect to the host tissue. In fact, it is crucial to replicate the morphology (hierarchical in nature) and mechanical response (highly-nonlinear) of natural tendons and ligaments. The aim of this study was to develop morphologically bioinspired hierarchical Nylon 6,6 electrospun assemblies recreating the structure and performance of tendons and ligaments. First, we built different electrospun bundles to find the optimal orientation of the nanofibers. A 2nd-level hierarchical assembly was fabricated with a dedicated process that allowed tightly joining the bundles one next to the other with an electrospun sheath, so as to improve the mechanical performance. Finally, a further hierarchical 3rd-level assembly was constructed by grouping several 2nd-level assemblies. The morphology of the different structures was assessed with scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution X-ray tomography, which allowed measuring the directionality of the nanofibers in the bundles and in the sheaths. The mechanical properties of the single bundles and of the 2nd-level assemblies were measured with tensile tests. The single bundles and the hierarchical assemblies showed morphology and directionality of the nanofibers similar to the tendons and ligaments. The strength and stiffness were comparable to that of tendons and ligaments. In conclusion, this work showed an innovative electrospinning production process to build nanofibrous Nylon 6,6 hierarchical assemblies which are suitable as future implantable devices and able to mimic the multiscale morphology and the biomechanical properties of tendons and ligaments."

However, the adverse effects of Cd<sup>2+</sup> on otoliths growth and swimming activity can be protected by supplementation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in exposure medium. Body burden of Cd<sup>2+</sup> in larvae was reduced upon the supplement with Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The overall results suggest that exposure to Cd<sup>2+</sup> can inhibit influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, leading to less deposition of CaCO<sub>3</sub> for otolith growth, and finally result in impaired balance control and swimming activity in zebrafish larvae."

Forensic gait analysis is the analysis, comparison and evaluation of features of gait to assist the investigation of crime. While there have been recent developments in automated gait recognition systems, gait analysis presented in criminal court to assist in identification currently relies on observational analysis by expert witnesses. Observational gait analysis has been the focus of considerable research, and it has been shown that the adoption of a systematic approach to both the observation and recording of features of gait improves the reliability of the analysis. The Sheffield Features of Gait Tool was developed by forensic gait analysis practitioners based on their casework and trial experience, and consists of more than a hundred features of gait and variances. This paper reports the findings of a study undertaken to assess the repeatability and reproducibility of the Sheffield Features of Gait Tool. Fourteen participants, with experience in observational gait analysis, viewed footage of computer generated avatars walking, and completed the features of gait tool on multiple occasions. The repeatability scores varied between participants from a highest score of 42.59 out of a maximum possible score of 45 (94.65%), to a lowest score of 30.76 (68.35%), with a mean score of 35.79 (79.54%) and a standard deviation of 3.59 (7.98%). The reproducibility scores for the assessment of each avatar varied from a highest score of 137.73 out of the best possible score of 180 (76.52%), to a lowest score of 127.21 (70.67%), with a mean score of 132.21 (73.45) and a standard deviation of 3.82 (2.12%). The results demonstrated that the use of the Sheffield Features of Gait Tool by experienced analysists resulted in what could be considered to be good levels of both repeatability and reproducibility. Some variation was shown to occur both between the results produced by different analysts, and between those produced from the analysis of different avatars. An understanding of the probative value of gait analysis evidence is an important facet of its submission as evidence, and the design and testing of standardized methods of analysis and comparison are an essential element of developing that understanding. This study is the first to test a purpose designed features of gait tool for use in forensic gait analysis."

Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), the primary risk factor for glaucoma, is thought to induce abnormally high strains in optic nerve head (ONH) tissues, which ultimately result in retinal ganglion cell damage and vision loss. The mechanisms by which excessive deformations result in vision loss remain incompletely understood. The ability of computational and in vitro models of the ONH to provide insight into these mechanisms, in many cases, depends on our ability to replicate the physiological environment, which in turn requires knowledge of tissue biomechanical properties. The majority of mechanical data published to date regarding the ONH has been obtained from tensile testing, yet compression has been shown to be the main mode of deformation in the ONH under elevated IOP. We have thus tested pig and rat ONH tissue using unconfined cyclic compression. The material constants C<sub>1</sub>, obtained from fitting the stress vs. strain data with a neo-Hookean material model, were 428 [367, 488] Pa and 64 [53, 76] Pa (mean [95% Confidence Interval]) for pig and rat optic nerve head, respectively. Additionally, we investigated the effects of strain rate and tissue storage on C1 values. These data will inform future efforts to understand and replicate the in vivo biomechanical environment of the ONH."

Implanting biomaterials have been regarded as hopeful strategies to restore neurological function. However, no optimized scaffold has been available. In this study, a novel 3D printing technology was used to fabricate the scaffold with designed structure. The composite biomaterials of collagen and chitosan were also adopted to balance both compatibility and strength. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a T8 complete-transection SCI model. Scaffolds of C/C (collagen/chitosan scaffold with freeze-drying technology) or 3D-C/C (collagen/chitosan scaffold with 3D printing technology) were implanted into the lesion. Compared with SCI or C/C group, 3D-C/C implants significantly promoted locomotor function with the elevation in Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) score and angle of inclined plane. Decreased latency and increased amplitude were observed both in motor-evoked potential and somatosensory-evoked potential in 3D-C/C group compared with SCI or C/C group, which further demonstrated the improvement of neurological recovery. Fiber tracking of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) showed the most fibers traversing the lesion in 3D-C/C group. Meanwhile, we observed that the correlations between the locomotor (BBB score or angle of inclined plane) and the DTI parameters (fractional anisotropy values) were positive. Although C/C implants markedly enhanced biotin dextran amine (BDA)-positive neural profiles compared with SCI group, rats implanted with 3D-C/C scaffold displayed the largest degree of BDA profiles regeneration. Collectively, our 3D-C/C scaffolds demonstrated significant therapeutic effects on rat complete-transected spinal cord model, which provides a promising and innovative therapeutic approach for SCI. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Developing relevant animal models whereby many variables can be efficiently controlled is thus essential to understanding this elusive relationship. Here, we use our repeated unpredictable stress (RUS) paradigm, in combination with our established mouse model of repetitive mild TBI (r-mTBI), to assess the impact of repeated exposures to these paradigms on behavioral and neurobiological measures. C57BL/6J male mice were exposed to RUS and r-mTBI at 3 and 6 months of age followed by batteries of behavioral testing. Mice were euthanized 10 days and 3 months post-exposure, with brain and plasma samples collected for molecular profiling. The RUS paradigm involved exposure to a predator odor (trimethylthiazoline; TMT) while under restraint, daily unstable social housing, five inescapable footshocks on separate days, and chronic social isolation. Animals receiving r-mTBI ( × 5) and stress were exposed to a single closed-head injury 1 h after each footshock. Stress-alone mice showed significant weight loss, recall of traumatic memories, and anxiety-like and passive stress-coping behavior when compared with control mice. However, in stress+r-mTBI animals, the changes in cued fear memory, anxiety, and stress-coping tests were diminished, possibly due to TBI-induced hyperactivity. We also report complex brain molecular and neuropathological findings. Stress and r-mTBI, either individually or comorbidly, were associated with a chronic reduction in dendritic spine GluN2A/GluN2B ratio in the hippocampus. While stress augmented the r-mTBI-dependent astrogliosis in the corpus callosum, it mitigated r-mTBI-induced increases in hippocampal pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor. We anticipate that our model will be a good platform to untangle the complex comorbid pathophysiology in stress disorders and r-mTBI."

Cyclic tensile strain (CTS) can increase chondrogenic gene expression and reduce hypertrophic gene expression in chondrocytes. miR-365 has been identified as a mechanoresponsive microRNA and is an important regulator of both chondrocyte hypertrophy and differentiation. Therefore, we hypothesized that CTS may promote the chondrogenesis of BMSCs by upregulating the expression of miR-365."

Because more ants collect more resources, this is a multiplicative process, and the expected logarithm of the amount of resources determines how successful the colony will be in the long run. Over 60 years ago, Kelly showed, using information theoretic techniques, that the rate of growth of resources for such a situation is optimized by a strategy of betting in proportion to the probability of pay-off. Thus, in the case of ants, the fraction of the colony foraging at a given location should be proportional to the probability that resources will be found there, a result widely applied in the mathematics of gambling. This theoretical optimum leads to predictions as to which collective ant movement strategies might have evolved. Here, we show how colony-level optimal foraging behaviour can be achieved by mapping movement to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, specifically Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). This can be done by the ants following a (noisy) local measurement of the (logarithm of) resource probability gradient (possibly supplemented with momentum, i.e. a propensity to move in the same direction). This maps the problem of foraging (via the information theory of gambling, stochastic dynamics and techniques employed within Bayesian statistics to efficiently sample from probability distributions) to simple models of ant foraging behaviour. This identification has broad applicability, facilitates the application of information theory approaches to understand movement ecology and unifies insights from existing biomechanical, cognitive, random and optimality movement paradigms. At the cost of requiring ants to obtain (noisy) resource gradient information, we show that this model is both efficient and matches a number of characteristics of real ant exploration."

Moreover, modulation of neuroplasticity markers, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and cholesterol levels was performed. Aged rats were intragastrically treated with 4-PSQ (5 mg/kg) for 7 days. Animals were tested in behavioral tasks, and then plasma (to determine cholesterol levels), hippocampus, and cerebral cortex (to determine neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and polysialyltransferase (PST) levels, and AChE activity) were removed. Our findings demonstrated that treatment of aged rats with 4-PSQ restored short-term and long-term memories in the object recognition tests. 4-PSQ treatment did not restore exploratory activity (rearings) but partially restored locomotor activity (crossings) reduced by aging in the open-field test. Moreover, the compound restored the reduction in the NCAM and PST levels, and AChE activity in cerebral structures, as well as the increase in the plasma cholesterol levels, caused by aging in rats. In conclusion, 4-PSQ restored cognitive impairment caused by aging in rats by modulating synaptic plasticity, cholinergic system, and cholesterol levels."

Fatigue studies often use match simulation protocols that expose all subjects to a standardized demand (e.g., a fixed distance/time). In those studies, the induced level of fatigue depends then on subjects' fatigability. If between-subject variability in fatigability is high, this might confound overall fatigue effects. Therefore, the first aim was to investigate whether a fatigue protocol with fixed demand causes alterations in landing patterns. Second, we assessed the relationship between fatigability and landing patterns as we hypothesized that athletes with high fatigability would show movement patterns that involve greater injury risk."

We studied the biomechanical characteristics of myopic sclera at the microscopic level using scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) with 7-μm in-plane resolution. Guinea pigs underwent form-deprivation (FD) in one eye from 4 to 12 days of age to induce myopia, and 12-μm-thick scleral cryosections were scanned using a custom-made SAM. Two-dimensional maps of the bulk modulus (K) and mass density (ρ) were derived from the SAM data using a frequency-domain approach. We assessed the effect on K and ρ exerted by: 1) level of induced myopia, 2) region (superior, inferior, nasal or temporal) and 3) eccentricity from the nerve using univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Induced myopia ranged between -3D and -9.3D (Mean intraocular difference of -6.2 ± 1.7D, N = 11). K decreased by 0.036 GPa for every 1.0 D increase in induced myopia across vertical sections (p < 0.001). Among induced myopia right eyes, K values in the inherently more myopic superior region were 0.088 GPa less than the inferior region (p = 0.002) and K in the proximal nasal region containing the central axis were 0.10 GPa less than temporal K (p = 0.036). K also increased 0.12 GPa for every 1 mm increase in superior vertical distance (p < 0.001), an effect that was blunted after 1 week of FD. Overall, trends for ρ were less apparent than for K. ρ values increased by 20.7 mg/cm<sup>3</sup> for every 1.00 D increase in induced myopia across horizontal sections (p < 0.001), and were greatest in the region containing the central posterior pole. ρ values in the inherently more myopic superior region were 13.1 mg/cm<sup>3</sup> greater than that found in inferior regions among control eyes (p = 0.002), and increased by 11.2 mg/cm<sup>3</sup> for every 1 mm increase in vertical distance (p = 0.001). This peripheral increase in ρ was blunted after 1 week of FD. Scleral material properties vary depending on the location in the sclera and the level of induced myopia. Bulk modulus was most reduced in the most myopic regions (both induced myopia and inherent regional myopia), and suggests that FD causes microscopic local decreases in sclera stiffness, while scleral mass density was most increased in the most myopic regions."

Thiamet-G (<i>O</i>-GlcNAcase inhibitor) could upregulate protein <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation level to improve dyskinesia in models of neurodegenerative diseases without any obvious detrimental side-effects. Therefore, we conducted this study to investigate the effects of protein <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation upregulation by Thiamet-G on the spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. Methods-We randomly assigned 74 rats to three groups: sham-operated group (Sham) with no lesion (<i>n</i> = 22), injured control group (SCI+SS) with saline solution (<i>n</i> = 26), and Thiamet-G treated group (SCI+Thiamet-G) (<i>n</i> = 26). We assessed Locomotor behavior using the Basso, Beattice, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale and evaluated histopathological alterations by morphometry and histochemistry. We also assessed potential inflammatory effects by microglia/macrophages immunohistochemistry, and potential apoptosis effects by caspase-3 western blot. Results-Thiamet-G treatment improved hindlimb motor functional recovery by inducing elevated protein <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation, and mitigated the severity, reduced the lesion size and promoted the structural recovery of the injured spinal cord. Thiamet-G treatment also inhibited microglia/macrophages infiltration at the injury sites and the caspase-3 mediated apoptosis pathway. Discussion-We conclude that Thiamet-G induced elevated protein <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation to ameliorate acute SCI, which could provide a potential novel therapeutic approach for SCI treatment."

We have developed a computationally efficient optimal control framework to predict human gaits based on optimization of a performance criterion without relying on experimental data. The framework generates three-dimensional muscle-driven simulations in 36 min on average-more than 20 times faster than existing simulations-by using direct collocation, implicit differential equations and algorithmic differentiation. Using this framework, we identified a multi-objective performance criterion combining energy and effort considerations that produces physiologically realistic walking gaits. The same criterion also predicted the walk-to-run transition and clinical gait deficiencies caused by muscle weakness and prosthesis use, suggesting that diverse healthy and pathological gaits can emerge from the same control strategy. The ability to predict the mechanics and energetics of a broad range of gaits with complex three-dimensional musculoskeletal models will allow testing novel hypotheses about gait control and hasten the development of optimal treatments for neuro-musculoskeletal disorders."

However, it is yet unclear if liver functions are affected in the early stage of the disease before the motor phase has appeared. The aim of our present study was thus to assess the effect of intranasal administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in different doses on striatum and liver functions. Deterioration of non-motor activities appeared on single exposure to MPTP along with rise in striatum oxidative stress and decline in antioxidant levels. Decreases in dopamine, noradrenaline, and GABA and increase in serotonin were detected in striatum. Motor coordination was impaired with a single dose of MPTP, and with repeated MPTP exposure, there was further significant impairment. Locomotor activity was affected from second exposure of MPTP, and the impairment increased with third MPTP exposure. Impairment of liver function through increase in serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels was observed after first MPTP insult, and it worsened with second and third administrations. First administration of MPTP triggered systemic inflammation showing significant increase in inflammatory markers in the liver. Our data shows for the first time that an intranasal route of entry of MPTP affects liver from the non-motor phase of PD itself, occurring concomitantly with the reduction of striatal dopamine. It also suggests that a single dose is not enough to bring about progression of the disease from non-motor to locomotor deficiency, and a repeated dose is needed to establish the motor severity phase in the rat intranasal MPTP model."

ICR male mice were fed for 14 weeks with either high-fat chow diet (HF, 60% kcal fat) or standard chow diet (CON, 10% kcal fat). HF, streptozotocin, and nicotinamide were used to induce hyperglycemia. NR or vehicle was delivered via stomach gavage for six weeks. Oral glucose tolerance test, Y-maze test, and nest construction test were conducted before and after the NR treatment period. NR treatment induced down-regulation of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1. NR reduced IL-1 expression significantly by 50% in whole brains of hyperglycemic mice. Other inflammatory markers including TNF-α and IL-6 were also attenuated by NR. Brain expression of amyloid-β precursor protein and presenilin 1 were reduced by NR. In addition, NR induced significant reduction of amyloid-β in whole brains of diabetic mice. NR treatment restored hyperglycemia-induced increases in brain karyopyknosis to the levels of controls. Nest construction test showed that NR improved hippocampus functions. Spatial recognition memory and locomotor activity were also improved by NR supplementation. These findings suggest that NR may be useful for treating cognitive impairment by inhibiting amyloidogenesis and neuroinflammation."

Per2, a circadian gene, plays a role in drug addiction. Previous studies using Per2-knockout mice have shown a role for Per2 in cocaine, morphine and alcohol addiction. In the present study, we investigated the role of Per2 in methamphetamine (METH) addiction using Per2-overexpression and knockout mice. We observed locomotor sensitization responses to METH administration, and rewarding effects using a conditioned place preference test. In addition, we measured expression levels of dopamine and dopamine-related genes (monoamine oxidase A, DA receptor 1, DA receptor 2, DA active transporter, tyrosine hydroxylase and cAMP response element-binding protein 1) in the striatum of the mice after repeated METH treatments, using qRT-PCR. Per2-overexpressed mice showed decreased locomotor sensitization and rewarding effects of METH compared to the wildtype mice, whereas the opposite was observed in Per2 knockout mice. Both types of transgenic mice showed altered expression levels of dopamine-related genes after repeated METH administration. Specifically, we observed lower dopamine levels in Per2-overexpressed mice and higher levels in Per2-knockout mice. Taken together, Per2 expression levels may influence the addictive effects of METH through the dopaminergic system in the striatum of mice."

Male adult rats were divided into alcohol (AL, 2 g/kg, by oral gavage), cigarette smoke (TB, six cigarettes, by inhalation), combined use (ALTB), or control (CT, water by oral gavage and environmental air) groups, treated twice a day (09.00 and 14.00 h). After 4 weeks, the rats were tested in the open field for behavioral analysis and euthanized for brain volume estimation and counting of neurons in the hippocampus. All treatments increased locomotion, and this behavior was higher in the ALTB than TB group. Latency to exit from the central area was lower in the ALTB than in the AL or CT groups. Rearing behavior increased in TB and decreased in AL and ALTB rats. Combined ALTB rats significantly increased their grooming behavior. Only the AL group showed decreased neuron counts and increased brain volume. Our results show that the isolated and combined uses of alcohol and cigarette smoke have diverse effects on behavioral and neuronal parameters in rats after long-term treatment."

This study examines the effect of methyl jasmonate (MJ), a neuroprotective bioactive compound isolated from jasminum grandiflorum, on motor functions, immunopositive cells of TH, dendritic neurons and dopamine contents in rotenone (Rot)-treated rats. Rats pretreated daily with MJ (100 mg/kg, i.p) for 21 days also received Rot (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min after each pretreatment for every 48 h for 21 days. Motor functions were assessed on day 22. The specific brain regions of the rats were processed for determination of dopamine contents, immunopositive cells of TH, neuronal cell morphology and dendritic aborizations. Rot impaired locomotion and rearing behavior, and decreased dopamine content in the striatum, prefrontal cortex and midbrain. It further reduced the expression of TH in the substantia nigra and striatum relative to vehicle-control (p < 0.05). Histopathologic studies revealed that Rot-treated rats had degenerated neurons with pyknotic nuclei and loss of nigrostriatal neuronal cells. Rot also altered the nigrostriatal dendritic neuronal networks, decreased the dendritic length and spine density. However, pretreatment with MJ improved motor deficits, increased TH activity and dopamine contents in the specific brain regions of Rot-treated rats. MJ also attenuated the cyto-architectural distortions, loss of neuronal cells and dendritic aborizations of the striatum of Rot-treated rats. These findings suggest that MJ may reverse the motor deficits associated with PD by modifying the key pathological abnormalities involved in the disease progression."

In response to physiological stimulants, including thrombin, platelets change shape, express adhesive molecules, aggregate, and secrete bioactive substances, but their subsequent fate is largely unknown. Here we examined late-stage structural, metabolic, and functional consequences of thrombin-induced platelet activation. Using a combination of confocal microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, flow cytometry, biochemical and biomechanical measurements, we showed that thrombin-induced activation is followed by time-dependent platelet dysfunction and disintegration. After ~30 minutes of incubation with thrombin, unlike with collagen or ADP, human platelets disintegrated into cellular fragments containing organelles, such as mitochondria, glycogen granules, and vacuoles. This platelet fragmentation was preceded by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, integrin α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> activation and phosphatidylserine exposure (activation phase), followed by mitochondrial depolarization, generation of reactive oxygen species, metabolic ATP depletion and impairment of platelet contractility along with dramatic cytoskeletal rearrangements, concomitant with platelet disintegration (death phase). Coincidentally with the platelet fragmentation, thrombin caused calpain activation but not activation of caspases 3 and 7. Our findings indicate that the late functional and structural damage of thrombin-activated platelets comprise a calpain-dependent platelet death pathway that shares some similarities with the programmed death of nucleated cells, but is unique to platelets, therefore representing a special form of cellular destruction. Fragmentation of activated platelets suggests that there is an underappreciated pathway of enhanced elimination of platelets from the circulation in (pro)thrombotic conditions once these cells have performed their functions."

Unfortunately, medications available for alcohol abuse have low efficacy or adverse side effects, creating a need to evaluate novel therapies. Growing research suggests that 18-Methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), an α3β4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist, may be effective at reducing ethanol consumption. However, its effects on binge-like ethanol consumption and other ethanol behaviors have not been examined. The present study examined the effect of α3β4 nAChRs antagonism on basal locomotor activity in male and female C57BL/6J mice. Next we tested the effect of 18-MC on binge-like ethanol consumption, ethanol-induced sedation, and ethanol metabolism. Finally, we tested the effect of α3β4 nAChRs on saccharin consumption to ensure effects were specific for ethanol. We observed that 18-MC decreased binge-like ethanol consumption without altering saccharin consumption, the sedative effects of ethanol, or ethanol metabolism. High doses of 18-MC caused locomotor sedation in C57BL/6J mice, but the effects were brief and likely did not contribute to differences in ethanol consumption. Our results support the involvement of the α3β4 nAChRs in binge-like ethanol intake, and further work should explore the use of 18-MC for treatment of alcohol use disorders."

We also assessed the ability of these compounds to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB). According to these data, we chose epoxide 4, which potently restored the locomotor activity in MPTP-treated mice and efficiently penetrated the BBB, to further explore its potential mechanism of action. Epoxide 4 was found to robustly promote the survival of cultured dopamine neurons, protect dopamine neurons against toxin-induced degeneration, and trigger the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade in cells of neuronal origin. Meanwhile, neither survival-promoting effect nor MAPK activation was observed in non-neuronal cells treated with epoxide 4. In the MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease, compound 4 increased the density of dopamine neuron fibers in the striatum, which can highlight its potential to stimulate striatal reinnervation and thus to halt disease progression. Taken together, these data indicate that epoxide 4 can be a promising compound for further development, not only as a symptomatic, but also as a neuroprotective and neurorestorative drug for Parkinson's disease."

NURR1 alterations have been linked to DA-associated brain disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. However, the association between NURR1 defects and the attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a DA-associated brain disease characterized by hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention, has never been demonstrated. To date, a comprehensive murine model of ADHD truly reflecting the whole complex human psychiatric disorder still does not exist. NURR1-knockout (NURR1-KO) mice have been reported to exhibit increased spontaneous locomotor activity, but their complete characterization is still lacking. In the present study a wide-ranging test battery was used to perform a comprehensive analysis of the behavioral phenotype of the male NURR1-KO mice. As a result, their hyperactive phenotype was confirmed, while their impulsive behavior was reported for the first time. On the other hand, no anxiety and alterations in motor coordination, sociability and memory were observed. Also, the number of mDA expressing tyrosine hydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamines biosynthesis, and DA level in brain were not impaired in NURR1-KO mice. Finally, hyperactivity has been shown to be recovered by treatment with methylphenidate, the first line psychostimulant drug used for ADHD. Overall, our study suggests that the NURR1 deficient male mouse may be a satisfactory model to study some ADHD behavioral phenotypes and to test the clinical efficacy of potential therapeutic agents."

Prior studies did not show changes in interlimb coordination when a light load was attached to the wrist, but the use of a bag to carry the load can be potentially disturbing since exaggerated movements of the bags may compromise balance. In this case, changes in interlimb coordination would be expected to minimize bag movements.

The current literature lacks evidence to confirm the relationship between PE and EE, if any, and whether short-term treatment with PE, EE, or PE+EE could be considered to correct age-related behavioral deficits. Three-, 8-, and 13-month-old C57BL/6 mice were assigned to either PE, EE, or PE+EE treatment groups (n = 12-16/group) for 4 weeks before behavioral testing and were compared to controls. Differential effects of the treatments on various behaviors and hippocampal gene expression were measured using an established behavioral battery and high-throughput qPCR respectively. Short-term EE enhanced locomotor activity at 9 and 14 months of age, whereas the combination of PE and EE reduced locomotor activity in the home cage at 14 months. Short-term EE also was found to reverse the age-related increase in anxiety at 9 months and spatial memory deficits at 14 months of age. Conversely, short-term PE induced spatial learning impairment and depressive-like behavior at four months but showed no effects in 9- and 14-month-old mice. PE and PE+EE, but not EE, modified the expression of several hippocampal genes at 9 months of age compared with control mice. In conclusion, short-term EE may help to alleviate age-related cognitive decline and increase in anxiety, without altering hippocampal gene expression. On the contrary, PE is detrimental at a young age for both affective-like behaviors and spatial learning and memory but showed no effects at middle and late middle age despite hippocampal gene expression alterations."

Here we show a dysregulation of hippocampal and cortical serotonergic (5-HT) receptor expression in heterozygous Cdkl5 knockout (KO) female mice, suggesting that impaired 5-HT neurotransmission contributes to CDD. We demonstrate that targeting impaired 5-HT signaling via the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) sertraline rescues CDD-related neurodevelopmental and behavioral defects in heterozygous Cdkl5 KO female mice. In particular, chronic treatment with sertraline normalized locomotion, stereotypic and autistic-like features, and spatial memory in Cdkl5 KO mice. These positive behavioral effects were accompanied by restored neuronal survival, dendritic development and synaptic connectivity. At a molecular level, sertraline increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and restored abnormal phosphorylation levels of tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) and its downstream target the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2). Since sertraline is an FDA-approved drug with an extensive safety and tolerability data package, even for children, our findings suggest that sertraline may improve neurodevelopment in children with CDD."

Currently, there are two competing theories on the flexion/extension axis of rotation of the knee with disparate radii of rotation, and thus differing movement patterns. The purpose of our study was to compare stair ascent kinematics and kinetics of single-radius (SR) and multiradius (MR) TKA subjects. We hypothesized that the knee kinematics and kinetics of SR TKA patients would more closely replicate healthy age matched controls during stair ascent than MR TKA patients, 1 year after TKA. Both patient groups had large improvements in biomechanical and clinical outcome measures following surgical intervention. However, the SR knee design performs closer to healthy controls than MR knees during stair ascent, supporting results that have been previously obtained for level walking. SR TKA subjects demonstrated reduced power production and sagittal moment compared with controls, albeit more than MR TKA subjects. This study demonstrates that patients who receive SR TKA have kinematics more closely aligned to normal patterns postoperatively than those who received an MR TKA. The power production and sagittal moment of the healthy controls most closely match previously published values of younger adults, SR TKA group most closely matches older adults, while the MR TKA group has lower power production and sagittal moments than either previously published age group. This strongly suggests that the biomechanical differences found in this study are evidence of functional deficiencies. Further research is needed to determine how these deficiencies progress with patient aging."

The effects of D-578 and paroxetine were next evaluated in a rat model for traumatic stress exposure - the single prolonged stress (SPS) model - which has been shown to have construct, predictive, and behavioral validity in modeling aspects of PTSD. Our results show that SPS had no effect on the acquisition of conditioned fear, but impaired extinction learning and extinction retention of fear behavior compared to sham treatment. D-578, but not paroxetine, attenuated the extinction and extinction-retention deficit induced by SPS. These findings suggest that D-578 has greater efficacy in normalizing traumatic stress-induced extinction-retention learning in a model for PTSD compared to paroxetine. Overall these results suggest that D-578, in addition to producing a robust and efficacious antidepressant effect, may attenuate maladaptive retention of fearful memories and support further testing of this agent for the pharmacotherapy of depression and PTSD."

The effects of the TPS were different from the Rigid orthosis, demonstrating that, alongside shape, material properties were a determinant factor for the obtained results. The findings of this study help clarify the role of a mechanism similar to a twisted osteoligamentous plate on controlling foot pronation and facilitating supination during the stance phase of walking."

Delayed lesions of ICH include neuron loss and white matter injury and the pathology of the lesions involves iron deposition and glial responses, which contribute to depressive-like behavior and cognitive impairment in animals. This study aimed to investigate the effects of FTY720 (0.3 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks) on iron deposition, glial responses, histological abnormalities and behavioral dysfunction in mice with ICH. The primary adverse long-term outcomes in our study of ICH mice were depressive-like behavior and impaired recognition memory. We found that FTY720 safely ameliorated depressive-like behavior and impaired recognition without affecting recovery of grip function and locomotor activity 28 days post-ICH. Moreover, we measured neuron loss, white matter lesions, lesion volume and iron deposition at day 28, which were attenuated in the FTY720-treated group compared to the ICH-control group, without changing initial hematoma volume on day 1 post-ICH. Long-term elevation of glial responses, including microglia activity and astrogliosis with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) expression was demonstrated by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining, which we found was attenuated by FTY720 treatment. Hence, FTY720 could become a novel therapeutic agent for improving long-term outcomes after ICH."

For example, knowing the set of causal genetic variants for drug response could revolutionize personalized medicine. We used <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> to investigate the genetic signature underlying behavioral variability in response to methylphenidate (MPH), a drug used in the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We exposed a wild type <i>D. melanogaster</i> population to MPH and a control treatment, and observed an increase in locomotor activity in MPH-exposed individuals. Whole-genome transcriptomic analyses revealed that the behavioral response to MPH was associated with abundant gene expression alterations. To confirm these patterns in a different genetic background, and to further advance knowledge on the genetic signature of drug response variability, we used a system of inbred lines, the <i>Drosophila</i> Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). Based on the DGRP, we showed that the behavioral response to MPH was strongly genotype-dependent. Using an integrative genomic approach, we incorporated known gene interactions into the genomic analyses of the DGRP, and identified putative candidate genes for variability in drug response. We successfully validated 71% of the investigated candidate genes by gene expression knockdown. Furthermore, we showed that MPH has cross-generational behavioral and transcriptomic effects. Our findings establish a foundation for understanding the genetic mechanisms driving genotype-specific responses to medical treatment, and highlight the opportunities that integrative genomic approaches have in optimizing medical treatment of complex diseases."

Galantamine is a reversible, competitive acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, used to treat patients with Alzheimeŕs disease. It has been demonstrated that galantamine increases cerebral neurogenesis and has a neuroprotective effect by binding to nicotinic receptors and has an anti-inflammatory effect due to its allosteric binding to the α7nAChR. In the present study, the effects of galantamine on functional recovery and histological outcome in a rat contusion model of SCI were analyzed. Male Wistar rats were submitted to SCI using a NYU/MASCIS impactor. The animals from the galantamine group were treated with 5 mg/kg galantamine intraperitoneally for 5 days. The Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan scale (BBB) was used to evaluate locomotor activity. The expression of beta3-tubulin, NFM, GFAP, O4, CD68 and CD3 was analyzed by flow cytometry. Rats that received galantamine had significantly higher BBB scores in comparison with the control lesion group. Galantamine treatment increased the percentage of NFM positive cells at 6 weeks post-injury and reduced the size of the lesion. The results indicate that galantamine increased tissue survival and accelerated hind limb motor function recovery. This is the first study that has shown the possibility of therapeutic use of galantamine in a model of acute spinal cord injury."

The immobility time in tail suspension test (TST) and forced swim test (FST) were used to assess the antidepressant effects. Prior administration of L-arginine (750 mg/kg, i.p.), a nitric oxide synthase substrate that enhances NO signaling or sildenafil (5 mg/kg, i.p.), a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor that enhances cGMP，blunted the antidepressant-like activity of Yueju pill (2.7g/kg, i.g.). Co-treatment of ineffective dose of Yueju pill (1.35g/kg, i.g.) with one of the reagents that suppress the NO/cGMP signaling, including methylene blue (10mg/kg, i.p.), an inhibitor of NOS; 7-NI (7-nitroinidazole, 30mg/kg, i.p.), an nNOS specific inhibitor; L-NAME (10 mg/kg, i.p.), a non-specific inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase; and MK-801 (0.05 mg/kg, i.p.), an NMDA receptor antagonist, reduced the immobility time in TST and FST, compared to those in vehicle or single drug treatment groups. Neither above drugs alone or co-administrated with Yueju pill affected locomotor activity or anxiety behavior in open field test. Thus, our results suggest that the antidepressant-like action of Yueju pill may depend on the inhibition of NMDA/NO/cGMP pathway."

Adult and aged rats were subjected to right MCAO for 30 min and post-conditioned (10 s) for 3 cycles. Sensory-motor tests were performed, and locomotion and anxiety-like behavior were evaluated. Molecular tests were done by detection kit, RT-PCR, and Western blotting techniques. Ninety-six hours after I/R post-conditioning, neurological signs, locomotion, anxiety-like behavior, and ischemic area were improved in young rats compared to 6 h after I/R post-conditioning (P < 0.001). Caspase-3 activity declined in the hippocampus and cortex of I/R post-conditioned young rats in 96 h after I/R post-conditioning compared with 6 h after I/R post-conditioning (P < 0.001).

A digital volume correlation (DVC)-based 3D optical coherence elastography (OCE) method is developed to measure the 3D displacement and strain tensors. The DVC algorithm includes a zero-mean normalized cross-correlation criterion-based coarse search regime, an inverse compositional Gauss-Newton fine search algorithm and a local ternary quadratic polynomial fitting strain calculation method. A 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) scanning protocol is proposed through theoretical analysis and experimental verification. Measurement errors of the DVC-based 3D OCE method are evaluated to be less than 2.0 μm for displacements and 0.30% for strains by rigid body motion experiments. The 3D displacements and strains of a phantom and a specimen of chicken breast tissue under compression are measured. Results of the phantom show a good agreement with theoretical analysis and tensile testing. The strains of the chicken breast tissue indicate anisotropic biomechanical properties. This study provides an effective method for 3D biomechanical property studies of soft tissue and improves the development of 3D OCE techniques."

This study examined how intermittent abstinence periods impact the physiological and behavioral effects of chronic oral MP self-administration in rats, and whether these effects persist following prolonged abstinence from the drug. Rats were treated orally with water, low-dose (LD), or high-dose (HD) MP, beginning at PND 28. This daily access continued for three consecutive weeks followed by a 1-week abstinence; after three repeats of this cycle, there was a 5-week abstinence period. Throughout the study, we examined body weight, food intake, locomotor activity, and anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors. During the treatment phase, HD MP decreased body weight, food intake, and depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, while it increased locomotor activity. During intermittent abstinence, the effects of MP on locomotor activity were eliminated. During prolonged abstinence, most of the effects of HD MP were ameliorated to control levels, with the exception of weight loss and anxiolytic effects. These findings suggest that intermittent exposure to chronic MP causes physiological and behavioral effects that are mostly reversible following prolonged abstinence."

In the modern era, it is impossible to ignore the usefulness of mobile phone technology in cases of emergency as many lives have been saved. However, the biological effects they may have on humans and other animals have been largely ignored and not been evaluated comprehensively. One of the reasons for this is the speedy uncontrollable growth of this technology which has surpassed our researching ability. Initiated with the first generation, the mobile telephony currently reaches to its fifth generation without being screened extensively for any biological effects that they may have on humans or on other animals. Mounting evidences suggest possible non-thermal biological effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (RF-EMR) on brain and behavior. Behavioral studies have particularly concentrated on the effects of RF-EMR on learning, memory, anxiety, and locomotion. The literature analysis on behavioral effects of RF-EMR demonstrates complex picture with conflicting observations. Nonetheless, numerous reports suggest a possible behavioral effect of RF-EMR. The scientific findings about this issue are presented in the current review. The possible neural and molecular mechanisms for the behavioral effects have been proposed in the light of available evidences from the literature."

The aim of this study was to compare disc degeneration grading systems with each other, and with biomechanical measures of disc function. Sixty-six motion segments (T8-9 to L5-S1) were dissected from cadavers aged 48-98 years. Disc function was assessed by measuring nucleus pressure (IDP) and maximum stresses in the annulus under 1 kN of compression. Detailed ""scores"" of disc degeneration were based on independent radiographic, macroscopic, and microscopic evaluations. For each evaluation, scores were used to assign a degeneration ""grade"" (I-IV), and functional measures were then correlated with degeneration scores and grades. Results showed that all measures were reliable (intraclass correlation coefficients: 0.82-0.99). Macroscopic and microscopic assessments were highly correlated with each other (r: 0.57-0.89, p < 0.001) but only weakly correlated with radiographic features. The overall macroscopic and microscopic scores of degeneration increased significantly with age and at lower spinal levels, although the influence of age was less marked in the case of the microscopic scores. IDP decreased with age and at lower spinal levels, but annulus stresses were more variable. Importantly, IDP and annulus stresses decreased consistently with all measures of disc degeneration, and these associations remained strong after controlling for age, gender, and spinal level. We conclude that radiographic and tissue-based assessments of disc degeneration are consistent with each other, and are more closely related to mechanical (dys)function than to age or spinal level. © 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The objective was to detect whether molecular biomarkers from peripheral blood leucocytes (PBLs) engage in TMJ OA lesions. Thirty-four six-week-old Sprague Dawley rats were used. The top upregulated gene ontology categories and gene-fold changes in PBLs were detected by a microarray analysis comparing rats that received 20-week unilateral anterior crossbite (UAC) treatment with age-matched controls (n = 4). Twenty weeks of UAC treatment had been reported to induce TMJ OA-like lesions. The other twenty-four rats were randomly placed in the UAC and control groups at 12- and 20-week time points (n = 6). The mRNA expression levels of the selected biomarkers derived from the microarray analysis and their protein expression in the alveolar bone and TMJ were detected. The microarray analysis indicated that the three most highly involved genes in PBLs were Egr1, Ephx1 and Il10, which were confirmed by real-time PCR detection. The increased protein expression levels of the three detected molecules were demonstrated in cartilage and subchondral bone (P < 0.05), and increased levels of EPHX1 were reported in discs (P < 0.05); however, increased levels were not present in the alveolar bone. Immunohistochemistry revealed the increased distribution of EGR1-positive, EXPH1-positive and IL10-positive cells predominantly in the osteochondral interface, with EXPH1 also present in TMJ discs. In conclusion, the increased mRNA expression of Egr1, Ephx1 and Il10 in PBLs may serve as potential biomarkers for developed osteoarthritic lesions relating to osteochondral interface hardness changes induced by dental biomechanical stimulation."

The upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin (Vim), intermediate filament proteins of astrocytes, is the hallmark of astrocyte activation and reactive gliosis in response to injury, ischemia or neurodegeneration. Reactive gliosis is essential for the protective role of astrocytes at acute stages of neurotrauma or ischemic stroke. However, GFAP and Vim were also linked to neural plasticity and regenerative responses in healthy and injured brain. Mice deficient for GFAP and vimentin (GFAP-/-Vim-/-) exhibit increased post-traumatic synaptic plasticity and increased basal and post-traumatic hippocampal neurogenesis. Here we assessed the locomotor and exploratory behavior of GFAP-/-Vim-/- mice, their learning, memory and memory extinction, by using the open field, object recognition and Morris water maze tests, trace fear conditioning, and by recording reversal learning in IntelliCages. While the locomotion, exploratory behavior and learning of GFAP-/-Vim-/- mice, as assessed by object recognition, the Morris water maze, and trace fear conditioning tests, were comparable to wildtype mice, GFAP-/-Vim-/- mice showed more pronounced memory extinction when tested in IntelliCages, a finding compatible with the scenario of an increased rate of reorganization of the hippocampal circuitry."

KA elicits sustained epileptic activity in mouse brain revealed by recurrent behavioral seizures, deteriorative neurodegeneration and various neurological deficits. However, to date, the vast majority of the studies used male mice only, and few studies on the comparison of brain injury between male and female mice in this model were reported. Epidemiological studies indicate that sex may affect the susceptibility to seizure response and neurodegeneration process. Therefore, this study focused on the effect of sex difference on KA-induced recurrent seizures and mortality, locomotor activity and cognitive impairment, and hippocampal neurodegeneration and reactive gliosis in mice. Our results showed that, compared to females, adult male mice exhibited worse performance in mortality rate, severity of epileptic seizures, and cognitive impairment indicated by novel object recognition task. Unexpectedly, post-KA male and female mice underwent similar decline and recovery of locomotor activity. KA-induced neurodegeneration in the whole hippocampus, particularly in CA1 and CA3 subregions, along with the deteriorative reactive gliosis in astrocytes and microglia, was more severe in males than that in females. These data provided the direct in vivo evidence that indicates the key role of sex difference in studies with KA mouse model, and this could be beneficial for optimizing the design of future studies."

In previous studies, we had reported the involvement of the reticular and anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) in the MK-801-evoked hyperactivity and other motor alterations. Consistent with the possibility that these responses were mediated by thalamic disinhibition, we examined the participation of cortical and hippocampal areas innervated by ATN in the responses elicited by the systemic administration of MK-801 (0.2 mg/kg) and compared them to the effects produced by the microinjection of a subconvulsive dose of bicuculline (GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist) in the ATN. We used the expression of Fos related antigen 2 (Fra-2) as a neuronal activity marker in the ATN and its projection areas such as hippocampus (HPC), retrosplenial cortex (RS), entorhinal cortex (EC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Dorsal (caudate-putamen, CPu) and ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens, core and shell, NAc,co and NAc,sh) were also studied. Behavioral and brain activation results suggest a partial overlap after the effect of MK-801 administration and ATN disinhibition. MK-801 and ATN disinhibition increases locomotor activity and disorganized movements, while ATN disinhibition also reduces rearing behavior. A significant increase in Fra-2 immunoreactivity (Fra-2-IR) in the ATN, mPFC (prelimbic area, PrL) and NAc,sh was observed after MK-801, while a different pattern of Fra-2-IR was detected following ATN disinhibition (e.g., increase in DG and NAc,sh, and decrease in PrL cortex). Overall, our data may contribute to the understanding of dysfunctional neural circuits involved in schizophrenia."

To date, a wide variety of cells has been used as biotherapies to cure SCI in different animal paradigms. Specifically, olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) is one of the most promising. Indeed, OECs have been shown to enhance recovery in many animal studies. Moreover, OECs transplantation has been applied to a paraplegic patient and have shown beneficial effects. However, it has been reported that the significant level of recovery varies among different patients. Therefore, it is of primary importance to enhance the regenerative efficiency of OECs for better translations. Recently, it has been shown that inhibiting ADAMTS4 expression in glial cells <i>in vitro</i> increases their synthesis of neurotrophic factors. We hypothesized that the expression of neurotrophic factors secreted by OECs can be increased by the deletion of ADAMTS4. Taking advantage of ADAMTS4<sup>-/-</sup> mouse line, we produce ADAMTS4 deficient primary OEC cultures and then we investigated their regenerative potential after SCI. By using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, bioluminescence imaging, measurement of locomotor activity, electrophysiological studies, and immunohistochemistry, our results show that ADAMTS4<sup>-/-</sup> olfactory bulb OEC (bOECs) primary cultures upregulate their trophic factor expression <i>in vitro</i>, and that the transplantation of ADAMTS4<sup>-/-</sup> bOECs in a severe SCI model increases functional recovery and tissue repair <i>in vivo</i>. Altogether, our study reveals, for the first time, that primary bOEC cultures transplantation can be potentialized by inhibition of the expression of ADAMTS4."

Compound 44 (AChE = 1.937 ± 0.066 µM; BuChE = 1.166 ± 0.088 µM; hAChE = 1.758 ± 0.095 µM; P<sub>e</sub> = 9.491 ± 0.34 × 10<sup>-6</sup> cm s<sup>1</sup>) showed positive results, which on further optimization led to the development of compound 67 (AChE = 0.464 ± 0.166 µM; BuChE = 0.754 ± 0.121 µM; hAChE = 0.472 ± 0.042 µM; P<sub>e</sub> = 13.92 ± 0.022 × 10<sup>-6</sup> cm s<sup>1</sup>). Compounds 44 and 67 produced significant displacement of propidium iodide from the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE. They were found to be safer to MC65 cells and decreased metal induced Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> aggregation. Further, in-vivo behavioral studies, on scopolamine induced amnesia model, the compounds resulted in better percentage spontaneous alternation scores and were safe, had no influence on locomotion in tested animal groups at dose of 3 mg/kg. Early pharmacokinetic assessment of optimized hit molecules was supportive for further drug development."

However, the mechanisms involved are still elusive. Aim of this study was to address the effects of voluntary running wheel in a toxic-demyelinating model of MS, in which demyelination and brain inflammation occur in response to cuprizone (CPZ) treatment. Mice were housed in standard or wheel-equipped cages starting from the day of CPZ or normal chow feeding for three or six weeks and evaluated for weight changes, locomotor skills and neuromuscular functions over the course of the experimental design. Biochemical, molecular biology and immunohistochemical analyses were performed. Exercise prevented early weight loss caused by CPZ, indicating improved wellness in these mice. Both neuromuscular function and motor coordination were significantly enhanced by exercise in CPZ-treated mice. Moreover, exercise induced an early protection against axonal damage and the loss of the myelin associated proteins, myelin basic protein (MBP) and 2',3'-Cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), in the striatum and the corpus callosum, in coincidence of a strongly attenuated microglia activation in both brain areas. Further, during the late phase of the treatment, exercise in CPZ mice reduced the recruitment of new OLs compared to sedentary CPZ mice, likely due to the precocious protection against myelin damage. Overall, these results suggest that life-style interventions can be effective against the demyelinating-inflammatory processes occurring in the brains of MS patients."

However, to our knowledge, there are no round-robin finite element analyses of long human bones with more than two participating biomechanics laboratories published yet, where the results of the experimental tests were not known in advance. We prepared a fresh-frozen human femur for a compression test in a universal testing machine measuring the strains at 10 bone locations as well as the deformation of the bone in terms of the displacement of the loading point at a load of 2 kN. The computed tomography data of the bone with a calibration phantom as well as the orientation of the bone in the testing machine with the according boundary conditions were delivered to seven participating laboratories. These were asked to perform a finite element analysis simulating the experimental setup and deliver their results to the coordinator without knowing the experimental results. Resultantly, four laboratories had deviations from the experimentally measured strains of less than 40%, and three laboratories had deviations of their numerically determined values compared to the experimental data of more than 120%. These deviations are thought to be based on different material laws and material data, as well as different material mapping methods. Investigations will be conducted to clarify and assess the reasons for the large deviations in the numerical data. It was shown that the precision of finite element models of the human femur is not yet as developed as desired by the biomechanics community."

Eleven elite cyclists obtained a one-week baseline of habitual sleep then restricted sleep to 4 h/night (SR) for three nights assessed through self-report and actigraphy. Pre and post-intervention measures were a box drop maximal vertical jump with 3D motion capture to assess physical performance and biomechanical changes, and Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) assessed changes in response time. Associations between biomechanical, physical, and cognitive performance measures were assessed. Participants restricted reported sleep from 7.4 ± 0.5 h/night at baseline to 4.0 ± 0.2 h/night and actigraphy indicated 6.7 ± 0.7 to 3.7 ± 0.2 h/night. Following SR, jump height decreased (0.44 ± 0.09 vs. 0.42 ± 0.10 m, p = 0.02, g = 0.21). Hip sagittal/knee frontal (Δ15.5°, p = 0.04, g = 0.40) and hip frontal/knee frontal (Δ11.0°, p < 0.01, g = 0.44) plane coordination variability increased after SR. Hip sagittal/knee frontal plane coordination variability after SR was associated with increasingly slower PVT response time (r = 0.63, p = 0.03). These findings suggest SR for three days decreased maximal jump performance. SR increased joint coordination variability and was associated with greater impairment in response time. SR leads to deviations from preferred movement patterns, which may have implications for decrements in athlete performance and increased injury risk."

Furthermore, this study aimed to evaluate the influence of the misfit values on the biomechanical behavior of the 3-unit fixed prosthetic frameworks using three-dimensional finite element analysis (3D-FEA). Forty frameworks (n = 10) were fabricated as follow: G1, Cerec Bluecam; G2, iTero; G3, 3Series; and G4, conventional method. The samples were randomized to measure marginal misfit using a high-precision three-dimensional (3D)-optical microscope. The results were submitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA), with the significance level set at 5%. The mean VM values of each group were used in creating the models by 3D-FEA with the misfit found in optical microscopy. The programs used were the InVesalius, Rhinoceros, SolidWorks, FEMAP and NEiNastran. The von Mises map was plotted for each model. The G4 showed the lowest mean VM value (16.73 μm), followed by G3 (20.71 μm), G2 (21.01 μm), and G1 (41.77 μm) (p < 0.001). G2 was more accurate than G1 (p < 0.05) and similar to G3 (p = 0.319). For PHM, G4 was the most accurate and did not present overextended values. With regard to NHM, the computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) systems were more accurate (-61.91 μm) than G4 (-95.36 μm) (p = 0.014). In biomechanical analysis, stress concentration caused by oblique loading is greater than caused by axial loading. In axial loading, G4 was the most favorable while G1 was the least favorable, biomechanically, in oblique loading, similar stress patterns were observed in all the models. The prosthetic screw was the most overloaded structure, but the material did not influence the stress distribution. The misfit prostheses showed a greater degree of stress than the controls (without misfit). The manufacturing method influenced the marginal misfit of the frameworks, with the conventional method being the most accurate and the Cerec Bluecam System (closed system) the least accurate. Biomechanically, fitting prostheses were more favorable than misfit prostheses."

The use of conspecific alarm substance (CAS) for inducing anxiety-like behaviors in fish species provides important translational insights of how aversive conditions modulate neurobehavioral functions. Because nicotine may elicit anxiolytic-like responses, here we investigated whether acute nicotine exposure prevents CAS-induced anxiogenic-like behaviors in zebrafish. We used both novel tank and light-dark tests as two well-established paradigms for measuring anxiety-like phenotypes. Fish were individually exposed to 1 mg/L nicotine or non-chlorinated water for 3 min and then transferred to other tanks in the absence or presence of 3.5 mL/L CAS for 5 min. Later, the behavior of fish was tested in the novel tank test or in the light-dark preference test. As expected, CAS triggered aversive behaviors by increasing bottom-dwelling, freezing, erratic movements, scototaxis, and risk assessment episodes. Nicotine alone elicited anxiolytic-like behaviors since it increased the time spent in the top, as well as the average duration of entry in the lit compartment. Moreover, nicotine pretreatment prevented CAS-induced aversive responses without changing locomotion, suggesting that anxiolysis could play a role, at least in part, to the behavioral effects of nicotine observed here. Overall, these novel findings show the beneficial effects of nicotine on anxiogenic responses in zebrafish. We also reinforce the practical advantages of this aquatic species to explore the relieving properties of nicotine, as well as to understand the neurobiological bases involved in anxiety-related disorders and associated therapeutic targets."

The antidepressant-like properties of ginsenoside Rg2 (GRg2) have been shown, while little is known about its anti-PTSD-like effects. In the present study, the PTSD-associated behavioral deficits in rats were induced following exposure to single prolonged stress (SPS). The results showed that the decreased time and entries in the open arms in elevated plus maze test (EPMT) and increased freezing duration in contextual fear paradigm (CFP) were reversed by GRg2 (10 and 20 mg/kg) without affecting the locomotor activity. In addition, GRg2 (10 and 20 mg/kg) could block the decreased levels of progesterone, allopregnanolone, serotonin (5-HT), 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), corticosterone (Cort) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the brain or serum. In summary, GRg2 alleviated the PTSD-associated behavioral deficits with biosynthesis of neurosteroids, normalization of serotonergic system and HPA axis dysfunction."

Although cardiac transcriptional remodeling is mediated by the activation of numerous signaling pathways that converge on a limited number of transcription factors (TFs) that promote hypertrophy (pro-hypertrophic TFs), the current therapeutic approach to prevent HF utilizes pharmacological inhibitors that largely target specific receptors that are activated in response to pathological stimuli. Thus, there is limited efficacy with the current pharmacological approaches to inhibit transcriptional remodeling associated with the development of HF. Recent evidence suggests that these pro-hypertrophic TFs co-localize at enhancers to cooperatively activate transcription associated with pathological cardiac remodeling. In disease states, including cancer and HF, evidence suggests that the general transcriptional machinery is disproportionately bound at enhancers. Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of transcriptional machinery that integrates pro-hypertrophic TFs may represent a promising alternative therapeutic approach to limit pathological remodeling associated with the development of HF."

These changes might affect feeding and its endocrine control. Feeding is regulated by central and peripheral hormones that either stimulate (e.g. orexin, ghrelin) or inhibit (e.g. irisin, cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript - CART, cholecystokinin - CCK and peptide YY -PYY) food intake. In this study we examined the effects of four climate change-related environmental factors (i.e. temperature, pH, turbulence and turbidity) on food intake and the hypothalamic and intestinal expressions of appetite regulators in fish, using goldfish as a model. High temperatures increased food intake and the brain expression of orexin, and decrease brain CART 1 and intestinal CCK, PYY and ghrelin. Low pHs decreased feeding and increased the expressions of CART1 and CART2 in the hypothalamus and CCK and PYY in the intestine. Turbulence (waves) induced an increase in food intake and a decrease in mRNA expression levels of both CART1 and CART2 in the hypothalamus and both CCK and PYY in the intestine. Turbidity (low visibility) did not affect food intake but increased locomotion and the time taken to reach satiation, while increasing brain orexin and intestinal PYY expression levels and lowering CART1 hypothalamic expression. The results of this study suggest that environmental stress affects feeding physiology of goldfish and bring new insights on how fish might respond to climate changes."

The present study was aimed to investigate an antidepressant activity of hyperoside (HYP) and protocatechuic acid (PCA), two polyphenols isolated from the aerial parts of this plant, using the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) in mice. The implication of the monoaminergic system in this effect was assessed and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression was measured. At doses 1.875, 3.75 and 7.5 mg/kg, HYP and PCA significantly reduced immobility in the FST and TST, without affecting locomotor activity of mice. Pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA 100 mg/kg, a serotonin synthesis inhibitor) or α-methyl-DL-tyrosine (AMPT 100 mg/kg, a catecholamine synthesis inhibitor) was able to prevent antidepressant-like effect of HYP and PCA (3.75 mg/kg). Sub-effective doses of fluoxetine (5 mg/kg) or reboxetine (2 mg/kg) were capable of potentiating the effect of a sub-effective dose of HYP (0.94 mg/kg) in the FST. Co-administration of sub-effective dose of PCA (0.94 mg/kg) and reboxetine (2 mg/kg) resulted in reducing immobility in the FST. The antidepressant-like effect of HYP and PCA was also prevented by the administration of sulpiride (50 mg/kg), a D2 antagonist. In addition, HYP (3.75 and 7.5 mg/kg) and PCA (7.5 mg/kg) improved the expression of hippocampal BDNF of mice subjected to TST. Altogether, our findings suggest that HYP and PCA exert antidepressant-like effects in mice, which was possibly mediated by monoaminergic system and the upregulation of BDNF level."

We examined the effects of subchronic (15 days) treatment with select dopaminergic medications, including bromocriptine, modafinil, dihydrexidine, rotigotine and pramipexole, in a mouse model of PTSD induced by single prolonged stress (mSPS). The potential antidepressant-like and anxiolytic effects of the medications were measured by the forced swim test (FST) and the elevated plus maze (EPM) test, respectively. In addition, we studied the effects of these medications on memory retrieval in an auditory fear conditioning (FC) test, on ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) induced by restraint stress, and on spontaneous locomotor activity (SLA). We report that a single exposure to a severe and complex set of stressors several days before testing increased immobility time in the FST and freezing in the FC paradigm and reduced the time spent in the open arms of the EPM. The stressed mice also displayed increased USVs, especially the short type. While none of the tested dopamine-mimetics exhibited anxiolytic-like effects, rotigotine produced antidepressant-like activity specifically in the mSPS-exposed animals. Moreover, both rotigotine and pramipexole shortened the duration of freezing in the fear conditioning test, but only in the mSPS-exposed mice. This study supports the hypothesis that the activation of dopaminergic D2/D3 receptors may be a promising pharmacotherapy for PTSD."

In particular, an estimation of the walking speed during the locomotion of those subjects would be a relevant indicator of the performance. However, if methods have already been proposed in the literature to compute this walking speed, none are directly usable in this context and with this population. For these reasons, the current study proposed to estimate the instantaneous walking speed with a shank-embedded Inertial Measurement Units based on a biomechanical model of the prosthetic lower limb. Averaged walking speed estimation has been quantified for nine individuals with transfemoral amputation walking on a treadmill at different speeds and slopes when wearing an instrumented knee ankle prosthesis. Experimental results demonstrated the ability of the model to estimate the walking speed with an accuracy of 9% (normalized root mean squared errors over all the patients), which is consistent with previous reported walking speed estimation errors. In addition, as the walking speed estimation is instantaneous, the proposed method can provide the estimation by the end of the stance phase, which is an originality compared to other methods based on step length estimation. The present method is relevant for the estimation of walking speed during real-life activities of above-knee amputees opening the way to direct activity monitoring from the prosthesis."

Pb-exposed M. shawi exhibited increased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in substantia nigra compacta (SNc), ventral tegmental area (VTA), locus coeruleus (LC), and dorsal striatum (DS), unlike the controls. This was correlated with decreased locomotor performance. A noticeable protective effect by co-treatment with curcumin-III was observed; in consequence, TH-immunoreactivity and locomotor disturbance were restored in Pb-treated Meriones. Our data results proved, on the one hand, an evident neurotoxic effect of acute Pb exposure and, on the other hand, a potent therapeutic effect of curcumin-III. Thereby, this compound may be recommended as a neuroprotective molecule for neurodegenerative disorders involving catecholaminergic impairment initiated by metallic elements."

By genetic modification and in vivo inhibitor approaches it was suggested that the Rho-associated kinases (ROCK1 and ROCK2) are involved in pro-fibrotic signalling in cardiac fibroblasts and that they may serve as targets for anti-fibrotic therapies. We demonstrate that simultaneous inhibition of ROCK1 and ROCK2 strongly interfered with tissue formation and their biomechanical properties in a model of engineered connective tissue (ECT), comprised of cardiac fibroblasts and collagen. These effects were observed with both rat and human ECT. Inhibitors of different chemistries, including the isoquinoline inhibitors Fasudil and H1152P as well as the pyrazol-phenyl inhibitor SR-3677, showed comparable effects. By combined treatment of ECT with TGF-β and H1152P, we could identify ROCK as a mediator of TGF-β-dependent tissue stiffening. Moreover, expression analyses suggested that lysyl oxidase (LOX) is a downstream target of the ROCK-actin-MRTF/SRF pathway and inhibition of this pathway by Latrunculin A and CCG-203971 showed similar anti-fibrotic effects in the ECT model as ROCK inhibitors. In line with the collagen crosslinking function of LOX, its inhibition by β-aminopropionitrile resulted in reduced ECT stiffness, but let tissue compaction unaffected. Finally, we show that ROCK inhibition also reduced the compaction and stiffness of engineered heart muscle tissues.

Developing an elemental structure based on this joint requires simplification in terms of the materials employed by keeping the mechanical and anatomical behaviors of the human lumbar spine. In the present study, the finite element (FE) of two motion segments of the human lumbar spine (L3/L4) was developed based on the CT scan data as the base for vertebrae geometry, verified geometry properties for another part of two motion segments, and combination of materials and loads obtained from the validated resources. Then, simplification occurred in four continuous steps such as omitting the annual fibers of annual matrix, representing the material of the annual matrix to the nucleus, demonstrating the material of annual matrix to the endplates too, and omitting the trabecular part of vertebrae. The present study aimed to propose the method for developing the basic structure of the human lumbar spine by simplifying its materials in the above-mentioned steps, analyzing the biomechanical effects of these four steps in terms of their internal and external responses, and validating the data obtained from the FE method. The validated simplified way introduced in this study can be used for future research by making implants, prosthesis, and modeling based on the human lumbar spine in other fields such as industrial design, building structures, or joints, which results in making the model easier, cheaper, and more effective."

BoNTs are divided into seven serotypes that comprise over 40 reported subtypes. BoNT/A1 and BoNT/B1 are currently the only subtypes approved for pharmaceutical use in the USA. While several other BoNT subtypes including BoNT/A2 and/A6 have been proposed as promising pharmaceuticals, detailed characterization using in vivo assays are essential to determine their pharmaceutical characteristics compared to the currently used BoNT/A1 and/B1. Several methods for studying BoNTs in mice are being used, but no objective and quantitative assay for assessment of functional outcomes after injection has been described. Here we describe the use of CatWalk XT as a new analytical tool for the objective and quantitative analysis of the paralytic effect after local intramuscular injection of BoNT subtypes A1, A2, A6, and B1. Catwalk is a sophisticated gait and locomotion analysis system that quantitatively analyzes a rodent's paw print dimensions and footfall patterns while traversing a glass plate during unforced walk. Significant changes were observed in several gait parameters in mice after local intramuscular injection of all tested BoNT subtypes, however, no changes were observed in mice injected intraperitoneally with the same BoNTs. While a clear difference in time to peak paralysis was observed between BoNT/A1 and/B1, injection of all four toxins resulted in a deficit in the injected limb with the other limbs functionally compensating and with no qualitative differences between the four BoNT subtypes. The presented data demonstrate the utility of CatWalk as a tool for functional outcomes after local BoNT injection through its ability to collect large amounts of quantitative data and objectively analyze sensitive changes in static and dynamic gait parameters."

While vibration transmissibility data exist for a natural standing position, it is anticipated that weight distribution will affect the response. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of changes in centre of pressure (COP) on the foot's biomechanical response. Twenty-one participants were exposed to vertical vibration of 30 mm/s, with a sine sweep from 10-200 Hz. <i>Z</i>-axis (vertical) vibration was measured at 24 locations on the right foot, with the COP shifted forward or toward the heel. A mixed model analysis at each location revealed significant differences (<i>p</i> < .001) in the transmissibility response when the COP was altered to the forefoot and rearfoot. In general, the peak frequency of the average vibration response increased for a region of the foot when the COP was shifted toward that region. <b>Practitioner Summary</b>: Altering the centre of pressure location resulted in changes in the transmission of vibration through the foot. The forward lean position was associated with the greatest amplitude of vibration transmissibility at the toes.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular response that occurs within the menisci following a surgical injury that allows bleeding into the joint space, and then to investigate the effect of dexamethasone (DEX) on this molecular response. Cell viability studies following acute controlled exposure to blood and blood plus DEX were also conducted. Forty-eight New Zealand white rabbits were randomly allocated into control, sham, surgical, and surgical  + DEX groups (each group n  =  6). Animals were sacrificed at 48 h and 9 weeks, and menisci were harvested. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels for key inflammatory, and degradative proteins, as well as mRNA levels for autophagy pathway molecules were quantified, and statistically significant changes were described. Meniscal cell viability was calculated by incubating groups of medial and lateral menisci in autologous blood, or autologous blood plus DEX for 48 h (each group n  =  4; total of eight medial and eight lateral menisci), and then conducting a histological live/dead assay. Results indicated a significant reduction in only medial meniscal cell viability when the tissue was exposed to blood in combination with DEX. A single administration of DEX following surgery significantly suppresses the elevated molecular expression for key inflammatory and degradative markers within menisci at 48 h and 9 weeks post-surgery.

However, current standards for hand protection from blunt impact are not based on quantitative measures of the likelihood of damage to the tissues. The aim of this study was to evaluate the probability of injury of the MCP and PIP joints of the human hand due to blunt impact. Impact testing was conducted on 21 fresh-frozen cadaveric hands. Unconstrained motion at every joint was allowed. All hands were imaged with computed tomography and dissected post-impact to quantify injury. An injury-risk curve was developed for each joint using a Weibull distribution with dorsal impact force as the predictive variable. The injury risks for PIP joints were similar, as were those for MCP joints. The risk of injury of the MCP joints from a given applied force was significantly greater than that of the PIP joints (p = 0.0006). The axial forces with a 50% injury risk for the MCP and PIP joints were 3.0 and 4.2 kN, respectively. This is the first study to have investigated the injury tolerance of the MCP and PIP joints. The proposed injury curves can be used for assessing the likelihood of tissue damage, for designing targeted protective solutions such as gloves, and for developing more biofidelic standards for assessing these solutions."

Accordingly, old male mice show changes in locomotor activity rhythms: a lengthened free-running period and decreased activity levels among others. To investigate whether testosterone replacement improves the age-related decline in circadian rhythmicity, we examined the effects of testosterone on the circadian rhythms of wheel running activity in old male mice. Intact male C57BL/6J mice (18-22 months old) were subcutaneously implanted with silicone tubes packed with testosterone propionate (TP) or cholesterol. TP treatment significantly decreased the daily wheel running revolutions in a normal light/dark (LD) cycle and in constant darkness (DD), but did not affect the free-running period. The same experiment performed on young male gonadectomized mice (3-5 months old) demonstrated that TP treatment significantly increased activity levels in both LD and DD. These results suggest that testosterone replacement exacerbates the age-related decline in circadian rhythmicity."

Here a new family of self-propelled multifunctional Janus particles is introduced that enables detecting changes in particle motion colorimetrically. The particles consist of an iron oxide core that provides color and magnetism, and a Janus coating that provides biospecific recognition and locomotive properties. In this approach, biomolecular interactions trigger changes in particle motion that are detected as variations in color when spotted on a piece of paper. These variations in color are then read and quantified with a custom-made smartphone app. The high surface area and magnetism of the particles makes them ideal building blocks for developing biosensors because they allow for the rapid capture of a target molecule and the removal of non-specific interactions. Biosensors engineered with the proposed multifunctional particles were able to detect the sepsis biomarker procalcitonin at clinically relevant concentrations within 13 min in whole blood, which is faster than other approaches requiring hour-long incubation steps under controlled conditions to detect the same biomarker in purified serum. The short assay time along with the point-of-need design makes these biosensors suitable for stratifying patients according to their sepsis risk level during triage independently of resource constraints."

One of the reasons for facet arthrosis after TDR has been speculated to be the hypermobility of artificial discs. Accordingly, the artificial disc that can constrain the hypermobility of ball-and-socket type artificial discs and reduce loading on facet joints is demanded. The proposed artificial disc, which is named as NewPro, was constructed based on the FDA-approved ProDisc but contained an interlocking system consisting of additional bars and grooves to control the range of motion (ROM) of lumbar spine in all anatomical planes. The three-dimensional finite element model of L1 to L5 was developed first, and the biomechanical effects were compared between ProDisc and NewPro. The ROM and facet contact force of NewPro were significantly decreased by 42.7% and 14% in bending and by 45.6% and 34.4% in torsion, respectively, compared with the values of ProDisc, thanks to the interlocking system. In addition, the ROM and facet contact force could be selectively constrained by modifying the location of the bars. The proposed artificial disc with the interlocking system was able to constrain the intersegmental rotation effectively and reduce excessive loading on facet joints, although wear and strength tests would be needed prior to clinical applications."

Biomedical engineering*,* [Optical measurement of the corneal oscillation for the determination of the intraocular pressure.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30231007),Optical measurement of the corneal oscillation for the determination of the intraocular pressure.,"Motivation Glaucoma is currently the most common irreversible cause of blindness worldwide. A significant risk factor is an individually increased intraocular pressure (IOP). A precise measurement method is needed to determine the IOP in order to support the diagnosis of the disease and to monitor the outcome of the IOP reduction as a medical intervention. A handheld device is under development with which the patient can perform self-measurements outside the clinical environment. Method For the measurement principle of the self-tonometer the eye is acoustically excited to oscillate, which is analyzed and attributed to the present IOP. In order to detect the corneal oscillation, an optical sensor is required which meets the demands of a compact, battery driven self-tonometer. A combination of an infrared diode and a phototransistor provides a high-resolution measurement of the corneal oscillation in the range of 10 μm-150 μm, which is compared to a reference sensor in the context of this study. By means of an angular arrangement of the emitter and the detector, the degree of reflected radiation of the cornea can be increased, allowing a measurement with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Results By adjusting the angle of incidence between the detector and the emitter, the signal-to-noise ratio was improved by 40 dB which now allows reasonable measurements of the corneal oscillation. For low amplitudes (10 μm) the signal-to-noise ratio is 10% higher than that of the commercial reference sensor. On the basis of amplitude variations at different IOP levels, the estimated standard uncertainty amounts to <0.5 mm Hg in the physiological pressure range with the proposed measuring approach. Conclusion With a compact and cost-effective approach, that suits the requirements for a handheld self-tonometer, the corneal oscillation can be detected with high temporal resolution. The cross-sensitivity of the sensor concept concerning a distance variation can be reduced by adding a distance sensor. Existing systematic influences of corneal biomechanics will be integrated in the sensor concept as a consecutive step."

As humans age, trabecular, cortical bone and IVD change in mechanical properties. These changes influence the movement of the FSU (displacements, rotations and disc bulges). This paper proposes a method to determine the influence of sex, age, weight and height on the movements of the FSU using a combination of the FEM and RSM. The work concentrates on the medium-sized human FSU (L3-L4 lumbar level with standard dimensions of IVD: width = 50 mm, depth = 35 mm and height = 11 mm). Also, the proposed method could be an improvement to the determination of risk of damage based on body mass index (BMI), as well as an alternative method of searching for a healthy weight. The method was developed as follows: First, a three-dimensional parameterized human healthy FSU FE model was generated based on the standard test (for compression, flexion, extension, lateral bending, torsion and shear). The movements of the FSU FE model based on the aforementioned standardized test when the sex, age, weight and height varies in a range for each individual (30-80 years; 70-120 kg; 160-190 cm) were simulated. Quadratic regression models were generated for each standardized test using RSM. An ANOVA test showed that all of the tests have a significant influence on weight and age, whereas height influences only those tests that involve rotation of the FSU (flexion, extension and lateral bending). Normal weight, overweight and obesity BMI classifications were considered in determining the healthy weight with the following constraints: the limit angles of flexion and lateral bending, as well as the maximum posterior bulge limit of the IVD, could not exceed of one-third of the spinal canal. The proposed method concluded that: (1) normal BMI values do not cause damage to the FSU, (2) some overweight BMI values may cause damage to the FSU for a certain range of ages and heights and (3) for BMI obesity values, the risk of damage to the FSU may be imminent."

It also influences medication efficacy. In this study, we studied the chronopharmacological profiles of antidepressants with various modes of action. We also investigated the effects of dosing time on the pharmacological activity of several antidepressants acting on serotonergic, noradrenergic, and/or dopaminergic neurons. C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally administered fluoxetine, imipramine, venlafaxine, or bupropion at 08:00 h (morning), 14:00 h (mid-day), 20:00 h (evening), or 02:00 h (mid-night). Antidepressant activity was evaluated by the tail suspension test. All antidepressants reduced immobility, and their activities varied according to the dosing time. Fluoxetine and imipramine induced relatively strong rhythms with high amplitudes. Their maximal effects were observed in the morning and evening, respectively. Venlafaxine and bupropion induced weak rhythms with maximal effects in the evening and dawn, respectively. These results suggest that the antidepressant activity is associated with circadian fluctuation, and antidepressants with different modes of action have different chronopharmacological profiles. They affect locomotor activity in animals placed in novel (unfamiliar) environments. Fluoxetine, imipramine, and venlafaxine reduced locomotor activity, whereas bupropion increased it. The effects on locomotor activity also vary with circadian rhythm, and the tested drugs showed a maximal effect during the light phase. The peak time was different from that in TST. Plasma and brain levels of all drugs were slightly higher in the morning than in the evening. The dosing time dependency of the antidepressant activity did not correlate with the sedative/stimulatory activity or tissue drug level. Therefore, these latter two factors may have only a small impact on circadian antidepressant activity fluctuations. The relative activity of the serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic systems may determine the chronopharmacological profiles of each drug. These results suggest the possibility that drug therapy be optimized by considering the dosing time when the antidepressant activity is high and other pharmacological activities leading to adverse effects are low. Further studies using animal models of depression and in clinical settings are necessary to confirm the effects of dosing time on depressed subjects."

However, some morphological and functional alterations of oocytes have been observed depending on the protocol applied. In this work, the mechanical response of individual human oocytes before and after a freeze-thawing procedure was characterised. Oocytes, immediately after retrieval, were morphologically evaluated by bright-field optical microscopy and their elasticity measured by indentation measurements using atomic force microscopy. Oocytes were then frozen according to the open-vitrification protocol and stored in liquid nitrogen. Afterwards, the same oocytes were thawed and the indentation measurements repeated. Using this approach, we can follow the elasticity of a set of single oocytes from retrieval up to the freeze-thawing procedure. The analysis of the resulting data shows that the retrieved healthy oocytes, which preserve their healthy morphological features after cryopreservation, maintain unchanged also in stiffness values. In contrast, oocytes having dysmorphic characteristics, before and/or after freeze-thawing, show significant variations in their mechanical response. In addition, the dysmorphic oocytes are generally observed to be softer than the healthy oocytes. Our results indicate that stiffness of healthy oocytes is not considerably affected by the open-vitrification-thawing procedure, and that distinct elasticity ranges can be identified for healthy and dysmorphic oocytes. These findings indicate that the mechanical characterization of oocytes represents an opportunity to detect cellular defects, and assess the quality and bio-viability of processes such as cryopreservation."

In humans, mutations in the NR2F1 gene lead to a global developmental delay and intellectual disabilities. While more than 30% of patients show behavioral features of autism spectrum disorder, 16% of haploinsufficient children show signs of hyperactivity and impulsivity. Loss of COUP-TFI in the cortical mouse primordium results in altered area organization and serotonin distribution, abnormal coordination of voluntary movements and learning and memory deficits. Here, we asked whether absence of COUP-TFI affects locomotor activity, anxiety, as well as depression. Mice mutant for COUP-TFI have normal motor coordination, but significant traits of hyperactivity, which does not seem to respond to N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists. However, no changes in anxiety, despite increased locomotor performances, were observed in the open field task. On the contrary, elevated plus maze and dark-light test explorations indicate a decreased anxiety-like behavior in COUP-TFI mutant mice. Finally, significantly reduced immobility in the forced swim test and no changes in anhedonia in the sucrose preference task suggest no particular depressive behaviors in mutant mice. Taken together, our study shows that loss of COUP-TFI leads to increased locomotor activity but less anxiety and contributes in further deciphering the pathophysiology of patients haploinsufficient for NR2F1."

Collagen, elastin, matrix metalloproteinase 2 and glycosaminoglycans concentrations were determined, along with relative levels of aortic medial amyloid-related factors (medin, milk fat globule-EGF factor 8, oligomers and fibrils). Measurements were combined with clinical data and statistical analyses performed. <b>Results:</b> The DA cohort can be divided based on their phenotype. One group shared similar characteristics with BAV patients, termed bicuspid like phenotype-tricuspid valve. The second group had high amyloid oligomer species present with a significantly lower <i>G</i>´ (<i>p</i> = .01), indicative of reduced elastic response of the tissue, termed amyloid-rich. <b>Conclusions:</b> We identified a group of DA patients with high amyloid oligomers and altered micromechanical and structural properties of the vessel wall.

The prevalence of myopia and high myopia is 28.3% and 4.0% of the global population, respectively, and these numbers are estimated to increase to 49.8% for myopia 9.8% for high myopia by 2050, thus making myopia a severe global socioeconomic problem. The eye shape has been receiving increasing attention as a possible biomarker for myopia. Among several modalities, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently considered to be the best to measure the 3-dimensional eye shape, and one study using MRI revealed that myopic eyes became much larger in all 3 dimensions, but more so in length (0.35 mm/D) than in height (0.19 mm/D) or in width (0.10 mm/D), which fitted in global and axial elongation models. Another recent study reported that emmetropic retinas were oblate but oblateness decreased with myopia progression. According to a study to evaluate eye shapes in high myopia, although all emmetropic eyes had a blunt shape, almost half of the high myopic eyes had a pointed shape. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that abnormal eye shape changes can cause not only simple myopia but also various ocular complications through biomechanical stretching. In this review, we highlight recent findings on eye shape changes in myopic eyes and abnormal eye shapes in pathologic myopia."

In this systematic review, a comprehensive overview of these models is provided. A systematic review was performed in MEDLINE and Scopus for articles using physical (e.g. dolls) and mathematical (e.g. computer simulations) biomechanical models for IHI-ST. After deduplication, the studies were independently screened by two researchers using PRISMA methodology and data extracted from the papers is represented in a ""7-steps description"", addressing the different processes occurring during IHI-ST. Eleven papers on physical models and 23 papers on mathematical models were included after the selection process. In both categories, some models focus on describing gross head kinematics during IHI-ST events, while others address the behavior of internal head- and eye structures in various levels of detail. In virtually all physical and mathematical models analyzed, injury thresholds are derived from scaled non-infant data. Studies focusing on head kinematics often use injury thresholds derived from impact studies. It remains unclear to what extent these thresholds reflect the failure thresholds of infant biological material. Future research should therefore focus on investigating failure thresholds of infant biological material as well as on possible alternative injury mechanism and alternative injury criteria for IHI-ST."

The Asymmetric repair technique using monofilament nylon suture was previously reported to have a higher tensile strength than the modified Lim-Tsai repair technique, but its repair stiffness and load to gap force were significantly lower. There is hence an unmet need to improve this technique and the substitution of nylon suture with barbed sutures may be the solution. <b>Methods:</b> Two groups consisting of 10 porcine tendons each were repaired with the six-strand Asymmetric repair technique using V-Loc<sup>®</sup> 3-0 and Supramid<sup>®</sup> 4-0 respectively. The repairs were subjected to a mechanical tester for static testing. The ultimate tensile strength, load to 2 mm gap force, repair stiffness, time taken to complete a repair and failure mechanism of the repairs were recorded and analyzed. <b>Results:</b> All the repairs using V-Loc<sup>®</sup> 3-0 sutures had significantly higher median values of ultimate tensile strength (64.1 N; 56.9 N), load to 2 mm gap force (39.2 N; 19.7 N), repair stiffness (6.4 N/mm; 4.7 N/mm) and time taken to complete a repair (9.4 mins; 7.7 mins). All the repairs using V-Loc<sup>®</sup> sutures failed by suture breakage while 80% of repairs using Supramid<sup>®</sup> sutures failed by suture pullout. <b>Conclusions:</b> The use of the barbed sutures in the Asymmetric repair technique, whilst more time consuming, has shown promising improvement to its biomechanical performance (i.e. better ultimate tensile strength, stiffness and resistance to gap formation)."

The present study examined sources of bias in the placement in graphic space of a symmetrical drawn figure (a tree). A previous study using a child sample found an overall leftward placement bias, independent of participants' reading/writing direction experience [Picard & Zarhbouch, 2014. Leftward spatial bias in children's drawing placement: Hemispheric activation versus directional hypotheses. <i>Laterality: Asymmetries of Body, Brain and Cognition</i>, <i>19</i>(1), 96-112]; moreover, the left-side bias was greater in right handers. Using an adult sample, the present study also found an overall left placement bias. This effect was significantly greater in right-handed than left-handed participants. Importantly, a left placement bias was significantly greater in left-to-right readers (English) than in participants whose first learned language was from right-to-left (Urdu, Arabic or Farsi). The fact that script directionality is associated with figure placement in our study but not in the previous study suggests that a certain threshold of experience in reading/writing in a given direction may be needed for scanning biases to exert a demonstrable effect on representational drawing. These findings suggest that biomechanical and cultural factors offer a more parsimonious account of spatial biases in drawing."

Locomotive and exploratory profiles were assessed using a video tracking software (ANY-Maze software) during a 5-min trial in a novel environment. Subsequently, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, oxidative stress markers, histological morphology, and expression of apoptotic proteins (p53 and Bax and caspase-3) and anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2) were assessed in the striatum. Results showed that Mn, EtOH, and their combination induced locomotor and motor deficits. Track plot analysis indicated that EtOH exacerbated the Mn-induced reduction in exploratory profiles of exposed rats. Similarly, exposure of rats to Mn, EtOH, or combination of Mn and EtOH resulted in decreased activities of anti-oxidant enzymes, diminished level of reduced glutathione, downregulated Bcl-2 expression, increased AChE activity, enhanced hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation levels, and upregulated expressions of p53, Bax, and caspase-3. Moreover, potentiation of Mn-induced striatal toxicity by EtOH co-exposure was dose dependent. Taken together, it seems that EtOH exacerbates Mn-induced neurobehavioral deficits, oxidative stress, and apoptosis induction via the regulation of p53, caspase-3, and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio-dependent pathway in rat striatum."

A long-acting opioid with low abuse liability that substitutes for a shorter-acting opioid may improve treatment of opioid use disorders (OUDs). We recently characterized an endomorphin (EM) analog (ZH853) that produced a longer duration of antinociception compared with morphine, but did not produce self-administration or several other adverse effects preclinically. Here, we further characterized ZH853 in tests of antinociception, abuse liability, and drug discrimination. A conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure, that included a locomotor activity assessment, was used to test abuse liability in rats. Subsequently, dopamine (DA) cell-somas located in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) from these rats were assessed by size using immunohistochemistry and Stereo Investigator software. A hot-plate antinociception test in male and female mice confirmed central penetration. Morphine-substitution effects of several EM analogs (ZH850, ZH831, and ZH853) were tested in a drug discrimination (DD) procedure in rats. Morphine produced dose-dependent CPP and locomotor sensitization and reduced the size of DA cell somas in VTA, whereas ZH853 did not produce any of these effects relative to control. The antinociceptive effects of ZH853 were <i>μ</i>-receptor selective since <i>β</i>-funaltrexamine antagonized these effects. Rats responded on a morphine-trained lever when injected with ZH831 and ZH853 during DD experiments. The favorable morphine-substitution effects of these EM analogs relative to their low abuse liability indicate promising novel compounds that may improve treatment of OUD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In this experiment, we investigated the preclinical effects of novel endomorphin analogs for use as substitution therapies for opioid use disorder, a problem that has contributed to an opioid overdose epidemic. Several endomorphin analogs substituted for morphine without producing adverse effects, including reward behaviors associated with abuse liability. These compounds have the potential to become important additional tools to treat opioid use disorders."

However, the neurobiological bases of these factors remain unknown. Here, we have used a combination of imaging, neurochemistry and behavioral techniques to investigate responses to the psychostimulant amphetamine in Marchigian Sardinian (msP) alcohol-preferring rats, a model of vulnerability to alcoholism. Specifically, we employed pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural circuits engaged by amphetamine challenge, and to relate functional reactivity to neurochemical and behavioral responses. Moreover, we studied self-administration of cocaine in the msP rats. We found stronger functional responses in the extended amygdala, alongside with increased release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens shell and augmented vertical locomotor activity compared with controls. Wistar and msP rats did not differ in operant cocaine self-administration under short access (2 hours) conditions, but msP rats exhibited a higher propensity to escalate drug intake following long access (6 hours). Our findings suggest that neurobiological and genetic mechanisms that convey vulnerability to excessive alcohol drinking also facilitate the transition from psychostimulants use to abuse."

In this study, we observed that spontaneous locomotor function recovery of hind limbs could also be detected in a canine thoracic (T8) spinal cord complete transection model. In addition, the spontaneous locomotor recovery of canines could be further promoted by chronic implantation of Taxol- or human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-modified bio-scaffolds. Moreover, functional bio-scaffolds implantation promoted locomotor outcome could be significantly weakened (drop to the spontaneous recovery level) but not totally abolished by resection in the lesion site. The neurological mechanism for functional bio-scaffolds improved locomotor outcome was primarily dependent on the formation of neuronal bridging but not the long-distance regeneration of descending motor axons throughout the lesion gap. Besides that, we found that spontaneously achieved locomotor recovery of hind limbs was unable to be weaken by repetitive resection of the lesion area, indicating the mechanism for spontaneous locomotor recovery was independent on functional neurological bridging throughout the lesion gap."

Most evidence suggests that biomechanics learning could be improved with the inclusion of laboratory experiences. However, implementing laboratories into biomechanics curriculum is difficult due to cost and time constraints. This study was conducted to evaluate whether hands-on activities in lecture improve qualitative biomechanics learning. A lecture format was compared to the same course with guided and unguided hands-on activities included during lecture. Test performance and student evaluations were compared between lecture formats to determine if hands-on experiences improve learning. The hands-on group performed better on the same test questions and they evaluated their overall course activities as beneficial to their learning. The findings suggest that guided hands-on experiences may improve learning compared to unguided activities. The hands-on experiences seem to provide an embodied cognitive learning experience, facilitating retention of learned material through three-dimensional and tactile mental representations. Findings from this research are currently shaping how biomechanics is taught to students at this university and could at other universities as well."

Failed fracture healing after orthopaedic surgical treatments are typically treated by secondary surgery; however, the negative correlation of time between primary and secondary surgeries with resultant health outcome and medical cost accumulation drives the need for improved diagnostic tools. This study describes the simultaneous use of multiple (n = 5) implantable flexible substrate wireless microelectromechanical (fsBioMEMS) sensors adhered to an intramedullary nail (IMN) to quantify the biomechanical environment along the length of fracture fixation hardware during simulated healing in ex vivo ovine tibiae. This study further describes the development of an antenna array for interrogation of five fsBioMEMS sensors simultaneously, and quantifies the ability of these sensors to transmit signal through overlaying soft tissues. The ex vivo data indicated significant differences associated with sensor location on the IMN (p < 0.01) and fracture state (p < 0.01). These data indicate that the fsBioMEMS sensor can serve as a tool to diagnose the current state of fracture healing, and further supports the use of the fsBioMEMS as a means to predict fracture healing due to the known existence of latency between changes in fracture site material properties and radiographic changes. © 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The Genium knee was introduced in 2011 containing an enhanced control concept including additional sensors and improved algorithms enabling a range of new functions for transfemoral amputees (TFAs). A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the effect of the Genium knee on ambulation, mobility, activities of daily living (ADLs) and quality of life compared to standard MPKs. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> The review was conducted according to PRISMA Guidelines and Recommendations of the State-of-Science Evidence Report Guidelines of the American Academy of Orthotists & Prosthetists. <b>Results:</b> Twelve articles were included in the review and reported primarily on active subjects (MFCL-3/4) transitioning from C-Leg to Genium knee systems. The overall validity of the evidence was medium to high with the exception of one article having low validity. Synthesis of biomechanical analyses concludes that gait during level walking, stairs and ramps is more physiological and symmetric following accommodation and use of the Genium in community ambulating TFAs. Further, sound side loading and compensatory motions are reduced. Transitioning from C-Leg to the Genium knee additionally resulted in significant improvements in mobility, quality of life and the performance in activities of daily living (ADLs). <b>Conclusion:</b> A high level of evidence was identified when assessing the ability of Genium to improve gait quality and safety and performance in ADLs. While individual studies report significant improvements in terms of quality of life and mobility, additional studies are needed to increase the evidence level. Implications for rehabilitation Microprocessor controlled prosthetic knees (MPKs) are well-established devices to serve patients with transfemoral amputation. Studies conducted mostly with the C-Leg MPK show that such knees significantly increase patient safety, ambulation, mobility, performance in activities of daily living and quality of life. Genium MPK includes advanced features which enable a range of new functions and functional benefits to patients. Transitioning from conventional MPKs (i.e., C-Leg) to Genium MPK resulted in more physiological gait, more equally distributed loading between the prosthetic and sound limbs, as well as reduced compensatory movements on the sounds side. These outcomes could potentially reduce the long-term risks of secondary physical complications in prosthetic users (i.e., osteoarthritis, osteoporosis). Genium significantly improved mobility, performance in activities of daily living, and quality of life in the patients using a conventional MPK (C-Leg). Different functioning principles of the MPKs presently available are responsible for different performance levels the knees offer to users. The amount of clinical evidence is also knee-dependent, with the C-Leg knee being most extensively tested in clinical studies. This systematic review concludes that Genium offers further advantages to transfemoral patients as compared to conventional MPKs (C-Leg)."

Multiple endpoints, including the physiological levels (growth, reproduction, and locomotion behaviors), stress-related gene expressions, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and degree of cell apoptosis, were evaluated on exposed nematodes and their progeny. Prolonged exposure to HBCD at concentrations of 2 nM-200 nM caused adverse physiological effects in the parental generation (F0), and these effects were also observed in the oﬀspring under HBCD-free conditions (F1). HBCD-induced toxicities could be transferred from parent to oﬀspring. The integrated gene expressions proﬁles showed that exposure to HBCD at concentrations of 20-200 nM resulted in obvious changes in stress-related gene expressions, which were more increased in F0 generation than in F1 generation. The increased expressions were pronounced in several genes related to oxidative stress and cell apoptosis, e.g., hsp-16.2, hsp-16.48, sod-1, sod-3 and cep-1 genes. Exposure to 200 nM of HBCD could signiﬁcantly increase ROS production and degree of cell apoptosis in the F0 and F1 generations. Therefore, it was speculated that HBCD exposure induced oxidative stress and cell apoptosis, which resulted in the adverse physiological effects. This finding is helpful for understanding the multi-generational effects and evaluating the potential risk of HBCD."

This study aimed to assess visual discrimination ability of cattle (Bos taurus) under conditions closer to the actual foraging situation. Twelve Japanese Black cows were afforded four successive opportunities to choose between green and dead forages presented as 25 × 25 cm patches 1, 2, or 3 m ahead while walking through a 25-m-long field area. Apparatuses for presenting the forages as visual stimuli were designed to minimize olfactory cues. The green forage differed from the dead forage in appearance (color and texture) and quality (digestible dry matter and crude protein). Cows preferred the green forage to the dead forage and were able to use the forages as visual cues to discriminate them. The proportion of green forage choices was 0.70-0.72 (different from the chance at P < 0.001), 0.57 (P < 0.05), and 0.53 (P ≥ 0.1) at the distances of 1, 2, and 3 m, respectively. The results indicate that the ability of ungulates to visually discriminate vegetation patches during foraging in grasslands would not be as high as that expected from the visual acuity reported in the previous indoor studies."

Fractures were simulated in 10 matched pairs of isolated cadaveric fibulae and plated with a single lateral locking plate for right-sided specimens, or with a one-third tubular plate and a 7-hole 2.4-mm minifragment adaption plate for left-sided specimens. An external rotation torque was applied at a rate of 1°/second, and torque at 10° was measured. Each fibula specimen was evaluated using a micro computed tomography scanner, and bone mineral density was calculated as milligrams of bone per cubic centimeter of volume. Dual nonlocked plating and locked plating specimens demonstrated torque measurements that were not significantly different at 10° of external rotation (1.48 N·m and 1.92 N·m, respectively; p = .093). The stiffness of the dual nonlocked plated and locked plating constructs were not significantly different (p = .228 and p = .543, respectively). The effect of bone mineral density on maximum torque at failure was not a reliable predictor of maximum torque in either the dual nonlocked plating or locked plating specimens (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.548 and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.096, respectively). We found no differences in torque at 10° of external rotation or stiffness between locking plate and dual nonlocking plate fixation constructs. This study provides evidence that dual nonlocked plating likely constitutes adequate fixation in situations in which a locking plate is being considered for comminuted distal fibula fractures."

Emerging data suggest that markedly increasing the intensity and variability of stepping practice may also be critical, although such strategies are discouraged during traditional rehabilitation. The goal of this study was to determine the individual and combined contributions of intensity and variability of stepping practice to improving walking speed and distance in individuals poststroke. Methods- This phase 2, randomized, blinded assessor clinical trial was performed between May 2015 and November 2018. Individuals between 18 and 85 years old with hemiparesis poststroke of >6 months duration were recruited. Of the 152 individuals screened, 97 were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 training groups, with 90 completing >10 sessions. Interventions consisted of either high-intensity stepping (70%-80% heart rate reserve) of variable, difficult stepping tasks (high variable), high-intensity stepping performing only forward walking (high forward), and low-intensity stepping in variable contexts at 30% to 40% heart rate reserve (low variable). Participants received up to 30 sessions over 2 months, with testing at baseline, post-training, and a 3-month follow-up. Primary outcomes included walking speeds and timed distance, with secondary measures of dynamic balance, transfers, spatiotemporal kinematics, and metabolic measures. Results- All walking gains were significantly greater following either high-intensity group versus low-variable training (all P<0.001) with significant correlations with stepping amount and rate (r=0.48-60; P<0.01). Additional gains in spatiotemporal symmetry were observed with high-intensity training, and balance confidence increased only following high-variable training in individuals with severe impairments. Conclusions- High-intensity stepping training resulted in greater improvements in walking ability and gait symmetry than low-intensity training in individuals with chronic stroke, with potential greater improvements in balance confidence.

Here, we report that colony-growing mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) generate significant tension on the colony surface through the contraction of a three-dimensional supracellular actomyosin cortex (3D-SAC). Disruption of the 3D-SAC, whose organization is dependent on the Rho/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) signals and E-cadherin, results in mESC colony destruction. Reciprocally, compression force, which is generated by the 3D-SAC, promotes colony growth and expression of Nanog and Oct4 in mESCs and blastocyst development of mouse embryos. These findings suggest that autonomous cell forces regulate embryonic stem cells fate determination and provide insight regarding the biomechanical regulation of embryonic development."

This modification is a result of accumulating evidence that biological factors also contribute to the etiology of the disease. The gut microbiota is a complicated ecosystem that profoundly influences the health of the host and can be modulated by the combined effects of environmental stimuli and genetic factors. Recently, enteric dysbacteriosis has been identified as a causal factor in the initiation and propagation of obesity-associated OA in animal models. Gut microbes and their components, microbe-associated lipid metabolites, and OA interact at both systemic and local levels through mechanisms that involve interplay with the innate immune system. However, the demonstration of causality in humans will require further studies. Nonetheless, probiotics, prebiotics, dietary habits and exercise, which aid the restoration of a healthy microbial community, are potential therapeutic approaches in the treatment of obesity-associated OA."

Despite its significance, foot pain is often interpreted as a normal part of aging and relatively ignored by health care providers as well as by the older people themselves. Accurate diagnosis of the cause of foot pain is possible for most cases via clinical evaluation without a costly workup. Clinicians should consider, not only musculoskeletal pathologies but also vascular and neurological disorders in older patients with foot pain. Fortunately, most patients improve with physiatric, nonoperative interventions involving biomechanical analysis, function-oriented rehabilitation programs and therapeutic exercise, the use of proper footwear and orthoses, and selected percutaneous interventions, as indicated.

Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanism underlying body-limb coordination could provide informative insights into the improvement of legged robot mobility. Sprawling locomotion is a walking gait with lateral bending exhibited in primitive legged vertebrates such as salamanders and newts. Because primitive animals are anticipated to possess the essence of quadruped motor control, their locomotion helps better understand body-limb coordination mechanism. Previous studies modeled neural networks in salamanders and employed it to control robots and investigate and emulate sprawling locomotion. However, these models predefined the relationship between the legs and the trunk, such that how body-limb coordination is attained is largely unknown. In this article, we demonstrate that sensory feedback facilitates body-limb coordination in sprawling locomotion and improves mobility through mathematical modeling and robot simulations. Our proposed model has cross-coupled sensory feedback, that is, bidirectional feedback from body to limb and limb to body, which leads to an appropriate relationship between the legs and the trunk without any predefined relationship. Resulting gaits are similar to the sprawling locomotion of salamanders and achieve high speed and energy efficiency that are at the same level as those of a neural network model, such as conventional models, optimizing the relationship between the legs and the trunk. Furthermore, sensory feedback contributes to the adaptability toward leg failure, and the bidirectionality of feedback facilitates parameter tuning for stable locomotion. These results suggest that cross-coupled sensory feedback facilitates sprawling locomotion and potentially plays an important role in the body-limb coordination mechanism."

Ceramic wear couples are a commonly used alternative to metals and therefore might be an alternative for hip resurfacing arthroplastys. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mechanical strength of femoral components made of an alumina-toughened zirconia composite by means of experimental testing and finite element analysis. For the mechanical characterization, ceramic femoral components (Ø: 48 mm) were tested under compression loading experimentally until fracture occurred or a maximum load of 85 kN was obtained. The femoral components were either loaded against a ceramic cup or a copper ring (outer diameter Ø: 7.0 mm). In addition, the complex geometry of the ceramic femoral component was simplified, and only the stem was loaded in a cantilever test until fracture. In addition, the fracture tests were numerically simulated to investigate the influence of additional loading conditions and geometric parameters, which were not experimentally tested. The experimental data were used for validation of the finite element analysis. None of the tested ceramic femoral components fractured at a compression load of 85 kN when they were loaded against a ceramic cup at an inclination angle of 45°. When the femoral components were loaded against a copper ring, the femoral components fractured at 29.9 kN at a testing angle of 45°. The fracture load was reduced when an angle of 30° and increased when an angle of 60° was simulated. Using an experimental cantilever test, the stem of the femoral component fractured at 1124.0 N. When the stem length was increased or the diameter was reduced by 10% in the finite element analysis, the fracture load was reduced. Decreasing the length or increasing the diameter led to an increase of the fracture load. The strongest influence was found for the reduction of the transition radius of the stem, with a decrease of the fracture load up to 27.2%. The analyzed femoral components made of alumina-toughened zirconia (ATZ) showed sufficient mechanical capability to withstand high loadings during unfavorable loading conditions. However, further biomechanical and tribological investigations are required before clinical application."

Recently, numerous studies suggested that dietary flavanones exhibit neuroprotective and antidepressant effects against various psycho-physiological conditions including depression. The present study is focused on the antidepressant and neuroprotective effects of naringenin (NAR) and the involvement of sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling in the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression. Twenty-four male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into four groups: CON group (saline s.c.), NAR group (NAR 50 mg/kg, p.o.), CUMS group (subjected to CUMS along with saline p.o.), and CUMS + NAR group (NAR 50 mg/kg p.o. along with CUMS) for 28 days including 1-week pre-treatment with NAR. The results showed that NAR was found to inhibit behavioral abnormalities including increased despair in force swim test, and reduced locomotor activity caused by CUMS in open field test. Moreover, Morris water maze revealed that NAR also mitigates CUMS-associated cognitive impairment. In addition to the antidepressant-like effect, NAR mitigates morphological anomalies in the hippocampal CA1 region and cortex. Furthermore, we observed brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Shh, GLI1, NKX2.2, and PAX6 were downregulated in the hippocampus of CUMS-exposed rats, which can be upregulated by NAR pre-treatment. GLI1 is main downstream signaling component of Shh signaling cascade, which further regulates the expression of homeodomain transcription factors PAX6 and NKX2.2."

Distinguishing postmortem damage in long bones as a result of fire damage from perimortem fractures is an important challenge in trauma analysis. During our case investigation of a burnt body from a fiery car crash, distinct perimortem traits on long bone fractures were still distinguishable along the charred areas. Next to timing of fractures and shortening the perimortem time gap suggesting that the fractures occurred when soft tissue was still present, the traits make it possible to distinguish blunt trauma caused by the accident from heat-induced bone damage. Applying this specific perimortem pattern could be an additional macroscopic tool to interpret blunt force trauma more accurately in the analysis of burnt remains."

The aim of this study is to demonstrate the relevance of carrier selection and sunscreen photostability when designing sunscreen formulations to protect the biomechanical barrier properties of human stratum corneum (SC) from solar ultraviolet (UV) damage. Biomechanical properties of SC samples were assayed after accelerated UVB damage through measurements of the SC's mechanical stress profile and corneocyte cohesion. A narrowband UVB (305-315 nm) lamp was used to expose SC samples to 5, 30, 125, and 265 J cm<sup>-2</sup> in order to magnify damage to the mechanical properties of the tissue and characterize the UV degradation dose response such that effects from smaller UV dosages can be extrapolated. Stresses in the SC decreased when treated with sunscreen components, highlighting their effect on the skin prior to UV exposure. Stresses increased with UVB exposure and in specimens treated with different sunscreens stresses varied dramatically at high UVB dosages. Specimens treated with sunscreen components without UVB exposure exhibited altered corneocyte cohesion. Both sunscreens studied prevented alteration of corneocyte cohesion by low UVB dosages, but differences in protection were observed at higher UVB dosages indicating UV degradation of one sunscreen. These results indicate the protection of individual sunscreen components vary over a range of UVB dosages, and components can even cause alteration of the biomechanical barrier properties of human SC before UV exposure. Therefore, detailed characterization of sunscreen formulation components is required to design robust protection from UV damage."

The orthosis was designed in agreement with morphological dimensions and its articulations distribution followed the same designing rules. The orthosis has six articulated arms attached to an articulated column. The orthosis was fully instrumented with actuators and position sensors at each articulation. The controller implemented a class of hybrid/position controller depending on the relative force exerted by the patient and the orthosis movement. The position information provided by each articulation was supplied to a distributed super-twisting differentiator to recover the corresponding angular velocity. A set of twisting controllers was implemented to regulate the position of the robot in agreement to predefined reference trajectories. Reference trajectories were obtained from a biomechanical-based analysis. The hybrid tracking control problem solved the automation of the assisted therapy to the patient, including the force feedback. The performance of the orthosis was tested with different dummy bodies with different resistance. The robust output feedback controller successfully tracked the reference trajectories despite the material of the dummy used during the testing. The orthosis was evaluated with two volunteers using a simple reference trajectory. Graphical Abstract General structure of the active back assisted orthosis."

We tackle this problem by observing the activity of a large population of neurons in the CNS of larval <i>Drosophila</i>. We focused on two major behaviors of the larvae - forward and backward locomotion - and analyzed the neuronal activity related to these behaviors during the fictive locomotion that occurs spontaneously in the isolated CNS. We expressed a genetically-encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP and a nuclear marker in all neurons and then used digitally scanned light-sheet microscopy to record (at a fast frame rate) neural activities in the entire ventral nerve cord (VNC). We developed image processing tools that automatically detected the cell position based on the nuclear staining and allocate the activity signals to each detected cell. We also applied a machine learning-based method that we recently developed to assign motor status in each time frame. Our experimental procedures and computational pipeline enabled systematic identification of neurons that showed characteristic motor activities in larval <i>Drosophila</i>.

Coupled with the biotechnologies of cell therapy or tissue engineering, iPSC technology will enormously contribute to human regenerative medicine. Before clinical application, such human iPSC (hiPSC)-based therapies should be assessed using large animal models that more closely match biological or biomechanical properties of human patients. Therefore, it is critical to generate large animal iPSCs, obtain their iPSC-derived somatic cells, and preclinically evaluate their therapeutic efficacy and safety in large animals. During the past decade, the establishment of iPSC lines of a series of large animal species has been documented, and the acquisition and preclinical evaluation of iPSC-derived somatic cells has also been reported. Despite this progress, significant obstacles, such as obtaining or preserving the bona fide pluripotency of large animal iPSCs, have been encountered. Simultaneously, studies of large animal iPSCs have been overlooked in comparison with those of mouse and hiPSCs, and this field deserves more attention and support due to its important preclinical relevance.

However, existing studies have focused on young athletes, while the kinematics of older golfers remain poorly documented. This study presents kinematic data for healthy senior golfers during swings performed with a driver and six-iron. Seventeen male golfers (62.2 ± 8.8 years) volunteered for participation and a 10-camera Vicon system (Oxford, UK) recorded kinematic data (500 Hz). A launch monitor (TrackMan, Vedbæk, Denmark) recorded club head speed and initial ball speed. Joint angles and peak velocities of the trunk and lower body were extracted at the top of the backswing, ball contact, and end of the swing. Intraclass correlations and standard error of measurement determined reliability, and pairwise statistics determined between-club differences. Swings with the driver had 7.3° less trunk extension and 4.3° less X-factor at backswing, and 10.5° less trunk flexion and 3.2° less X-factor at ball impact. Older adults portray several differences in lower body kinematics between a six-iron and driver but maintain good to excellent reliability (0.728-0.997) during the swings. Comparisons with previous research also showed senior athletes produce slower club head and ball speeds than younger golfers, and that kinematic differences exist between the populations."

Eleven young highly-trained female ice hockey players performed two 40-m skating sprints on two separate days to evaluate inter-trial and test-retest reliability. The velocity-time data recorded by a radar device was used to calculate the kinetics variables of the skating sprint acceleration: maximal theoretical force (F<sub>0</sub>), maximal theoretical velocity (V<sub>0</sub>), maximal theoretical power (P<sub>max</sub>) and the slope of the linear force-velocity relationship (S<sub>FV</sub>). S<sub>FV</sub> and S<sub>FVrel</sub> variables (the slope of the linear relationship between horizontal force relative to body mass and velocity) demonstrated '<i>low'</i> to <i>'moderate'</i> intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). All other variables revealed <i>'acceptable'</i> inter-trial and test-retest reliability (ICC ≥ 0.75 and coefficient of variation [CV] ≤ 10%). Furthermore, test-retest reliability (ICC and CV) and sensitivity [Standard Error of Measurement (SEMs) ≤ Small Worthwhile Change (SWCs)] were higher when averaging the two trials compared to the best trial (40-m split time) only. These findings offer a promising and simple method to monitor training-induced changes in macroscopic mechanical variables of ice hockey skating performance."

Naloxone is a typical mu-opioid receptor antagonist widely used in clinical treatment for opioid overdose and opioid abuse. However, it remains unclear whether naloxone affects morphine-induced cognitive deficits. Using the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), the present study investigated cognitive profiles including attention, impulsivity, compulsivity, and processing speed in repeated morphine-treated mice. Repeated morphine administration (10 mg/kg, i.p.) induced complex cognitive changes including decreased attention and increased impulsivity, compulsivity, processing speed. Systemic naloxone administration (5 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed these cognitive changes under the heavy perceptual load in 5-CSRTT. Using the novel object recognition (NOR), Y-maze and open-field test (OFT), the present study investigated the memory ability and locomotor activity. Naloxone reversed the effect of morphine on recognition memory and locomotion but had no effect on working memory. In addition, repeated morphine administration decreased the expression of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HIP), and these effects were significantly reversed by naloxone in PFC. Our study suggests that repeated exposure to morphine affects multiple cognitive aspects and impairs synaptic functions. Systemic naloxone treatment reverses the mu-opioids-induced cognitive changes, especially under the heavy perceptual load, possibly by restoring the synaptic dysfunctions."

The use of a viscoelastic polymer, normally known as Silly Putty, as the electrification material and as the matrix of a carbon-nanotube-filled composite (CNT-putty) electrode endows the SS-TENG the capability of adapting to arbitrary irregular surfaces and instantaneous healing from mechanical damage (almost completely recovered in 3 min without extra stimuli). Furthermore, the output performances of the SS-TENG have also been significantly improved because (i) the ideal soft contact is achieved at the solid-solid interfaces for more effective contact electrification and (ii) the introduced cation dopants make the putty even more tribo-negative than polytetrafluoroethylene. The SS-TENG can be adhered to any curvy surface, tailored, and reshaped into arbitrary configurations and utilized as a power supply for small electronics, suggesting promising applications in soft electronics/robotics in the future."

A cohort comparison study of 148 participants, 70 experiencing low back pain, had lumbopelvic kinematics, exercise frequency and movement variability measured during a 10 minute trial. Magnitude-based inference was used to assess for familiarisation, using plots of variation over time with familiarised reference ranges. The no pain group took 170 seconds, and the back pain group took 150 seconds, to familiarise. A familiarisation period of at least 170 seconds (2.8 minutes) is recommended. This justifies, and provides a familiarisation time for use of the FRED as a motor control intervention."

This narrative review focusses on biomechanical aspects of the block phase and the subsequent first flight and stance phases. We discuss specific features of technique and how they may be important for a high level of performance during the start. The need to appropriately quantify performance is discussed first; external power has recently become more frequently adopted because it provides a single measure that appropriately accounts for the requirement to increase horizontal velocity as much as possible in as little time as possible. In the ""set"" position, a relatively wide range of body configurations are adopted by sprinters irrespective of their ability level, and between-sprinter differences in these general positions do not appear to be directly associated with block phase performance. Greater average force production during the push against the blocks, especially from the rear leg and particularly the hip, appears to be important for performance. Immediately after exiting the blocks, shorter first flight durations and longer first stance durations (allowing more time to generate propulsive force) are found in sprinters of a higher performance level. During the first stance phase, the ankle and knee both appear to play an important role in energy generation, and higher levels of performance may be associated with a stiffer ankle joint and the ability to extend the knee throughout stance. However, the role of the sprinter's body configuration at touchdown remains unclear, and the roles of strength and anatomy in these associations between technique and performance also remain largely unexplored. Other aspects such as the sex, age and performance level of the studied sprinters, as well as issues with measurement and comparisons with athletes with amputations, are also briefly considered."

Traditionally, this analysis has relied on captive laboratory force plates and associated downstream biomechanical modeling, and many researchers have approached the problem of portability by extrapolating models built on linear statistics. An alternative approach would be to capitalize on recent advances in deep learning. In this study, using the pre-trained CaffeNet convolutional neural network (CNN) model, multivariate regression of marker-based motion capture to 3D KJM for three sports-related movement types were compared. The strongest overall mean correlation to source modeling of 0.8895 was achieved over the initial 33% of stance phase for sidestepping. The accuracy of these mean predictions of the three critical KJM associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury demonstrate the feasibility of on-field knee injury assessment using deep learning in lieu of laboratory embedded force plates. This multidisciplinary research approach significantly advances machine representation of real-world physical models with practical application for both community and professional level athletes."

Although environmentally relevant Pb poisoning is preventable, insidious Pb contaminants are still a major threat to human health. Herein, we reported that exposure to Pb at environmentally relevant concentration level (1 μg/L, 10 μg/L and 100 μg/L), disturbed the courtship behavior of adult male zebrafish and further altered the transcriptional patterns of key genes involved in testicular steroidogenesis (igf3, amh, piwil1, lhcgr, fshr, cyp11c1, star, cyp19a1a, cyp19a1b) and apoptosis (bax, cytoC, caspase 9, caspase 3, puma). Both the behavioral and the transcriptional profiles share a similar biphasic dose response, with stimulatory effects after low-level exposure and inhibitory effects after high-level exposure. This results revealed the endocrine disrupting effects of Pb even at an environmentally relevant level within the concentration range of ambient water quality criteria (AWQC) and the reliability of locomotion fingerprint as the indicator for detecting the risk induced by Pb pollution. Current research, for the first time, employed the ZebraTower system as the biological early warning system (BEWS) to find that Pb exerted biphasic effects on the courtship behavior and endocrine regulation of male adult zebrafish. Methodologically, we firstly propose an efficient solution to monitor and assess the risk of Pb exposure by combining the (BEWS) and data analyzing methods such as zebrafish phenomics, which would make a contribution to the detection and prevention of environmentally relevant Pb poisoning."

The purpose of this study was to examine trunk and upper extremity kinematics and segmental velocities during the offside forehand polo swing between male and female athletes. Ten female and 17 male professional polo athletes volunteered. An electromagnetic tracking system collected kinematic data at 100 Hz while participants performed three offside forehand polo swings from a stationary wooden horse. One-way ANOVAs revealed statistically significant differences (<i>p</i><0.05) in all kinematic variables and segmental velocities. Specifically, males exhibited a greater mean difference (MD=23°) of trunk flexion at take away (TA) and top of backswing (TOB)(MD=29°) trunk lateral flexion at ball contact (BC)(MD=23°), trunk rotation at TA(MD=97°) and TOB(MD=118°), shoulder abduction at TOB(MD=64°), and shoulder elevation at TOB(MD=13°) and BC(MD=40°). Females displayed greater trunk rotation at BC(MD=91°), shoulder elevation at TA(MD=19°), and elbow flexion at TA(MD=90°). Additionally, females generated greater segmental velocities early in the swing, while the males generated velocity later. The movement patterns observed amongst the males suggest energy is being transferred more efficiently along the kinetic chain, thus more efficient swing mechanics, but further investigation into the role of the trunk and lumbopelvic-hip complex in reference to the polo swing is warranted."

Stair fall risk has typically been assessed by quantifying mean differences between subject groups (e.g. older vs. younger individuals) for a number of biomechanical parameters individually indicative of risk, e.g., a reduced foot clearance with respect to the stair edge, which increases the chances of a trip. This approach neglects that individuals within a particular group may also exhibit other concurrent conservative strategies that could reduce the overall risk for a fall, e.g. a decreased variance in foot clearance. The purpose of the present study was to establish a multivariate approach that characterises the overall stepping behaviour of an individual. Twenty-five younger adults (age: 24.5 ± 3.3 y) and 70 older adults (age: 71.1 ± 4.1 y) descended a custom-built instrumented seven-step staircase at their self-selected pace in a step-over-step manner without using the handrails. Measured biomechanical parameters included: 1) Maximal centre of mass angular acceleration, 2) Foot clearance, 3) Proportion of foot length in contact with stair, 4) Required coefficient of friction, 5) Cadence, 6) Variance of these parameters. As a conventional analysis, a one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc testing was used to identify differences between younger adults, older fallers and non-fallers. To examine differences in overall biomechanical stair descent behaviours between individuals, k-means clustering was used. The conventional grouping approach showed an effect of age and fall history on several single risk factors. The multivariate approach identified four clusters. Three clusters differed from the overall mean by showing both risky and conservative strategies on the biomechanical outcome measures, whereas the fourth cluster did not display any particularly risky or conservative strategies. In contrast to the conventional approach, the multivariate approach showed the stepping behaviours identified did not contain only older adults or previous fallers. This highlights the limited predictive power for stair fall risk of approaches based on single-parameter comparisons between predetermined groups. Establishing the predictive power of the current approach for future stair falls in older people is imperative for its implementation as a falls prevention tool."

We hypothesised that by altering the position of the foot pressure, the lower body stabilisation would improve which in turn would enhance weight distribution and underpinning lower body joint kinematics. Eight professional golf association (PGA) golf coaches performed five golf swings, recorded using a nine-camera motion analysis system synchronised with two force platforms. Following verbal intervention, they performed further five swings. One participant returned following a one-year intervention programme and performed five additional golf swings to provide a longitudinal case study analysis. Golf performance was unchanged evidenced by the velocity and angle of the club at ball impact (BI), although the one-year intervention significantly changed the percentage of weight experienced at each foot in the final 9% of downswing, which provided an even weight distribution at BI. This is a highly relevant finding as it indicates that the foot centre of pressure was central to the base of support and in-line with the centre of mass (CoM), indicating significantly increased stability when the CoM is near maximal acceleration."

It is also apparent that such changes can manifest as thickening and increased stiffness of tendinous structures. What remains unknown are the biomechanical ramifications of these changes and how they should affect the surgical management of lower extremity injuries. Previous research suggests that the Achilles tendon demonstrates increased stiffness in the presence of diabetes. It is therefore reasonable to presume that increased collagen glycation and the resultant tendon stiffness can also lead to decreased extensibility and shortening of the peroneus longus and brevis tendons. The significance of this leads us to the conclusion that glycation of the peroneal tendons can create a deforming force in displaced lateral malleolar fractures because of the adjacent position of the peroneal tendons relative to the lateral malleolus. Complications stemming from this can lead to increased difficulty in reducing fibular fractures and subsequent shortening of the fibula. For the purpose of this article, we present 2 cases, 1 using open reduction with internal fixation and the other with external fixation. We will demonstrate that, in both reduction methods, lengthening of the peroneal tendons can be a useful adjunct procedure to aid in restoration of fibular length in diabetic ankle fractures."

This study aimed to assess pedicle screw (PS) shift without loosening to identify the mechanism of the change in disc angle after posterior fusion for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis (DLS). Sixty-three consecutive patients who underwent facet fusion for L4 single-level DLS were retrospectively reviewed using computed tomography (CT) immediately after surgery and 6 months postoperatively. Twenty-two patients (88 PSs) in whom the disc angle had decreased by more than 4° at 6-month postoperative radiographic follow-up were selected to more readily identify and quantify PS shift. Six patients with PS loosening and/or nonunion were excluded. We reconstructed a CT plane, vertical to the cranial endplate of the vertebrae and passing through the cannula used for percutaneous PSs. Angle α, which is formed by the cranial endplate and the cannula on this plane, was measured. A change in angle α of more than 2° between the immediate postoperative period and the 6-month follow-up was defined as a PS shift. Angle α did not change by more than 2° in any of the 44 PSs in the upper vertebrae of the fused segment. In the lower vertebrae, angle α changed by more than 2° in 22 of 44 PSs. The change in angle α in the lower vertebrae (average, 2.3°) was significantly greater than that in the upper vertebrae (average, 0.2°) (P < 0.0001). The change in the disc angle was not relevant to clinical outcomes assessed by the Japanese Orthopaedic Association Back Pain Evaluation Questionnaire, the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, and the visual analogue scale. The disc angle at the fused segment returned to preoperative neutral position due to PS shift without loosening, mainly in the lower vertebrae. PS shift is caused by bone remodeling in response to biomechanical load, similar to that in orthodontic tooth movement. As PS has limited ability to maintain a lordotic disc angle, even with the insertion of a cage, lumbar alignment will return to preoperative neutral position owing to cage subsidence or adjacent segment disease. These findings might indicate that it is not necessary to correct the spinal alignment for DLS."

This injury requires a long recovery process, with no guarantee of returning to the pre-injury level. When a rupture happens during natural life, movement analysis can provide useful insights concerning patterns of rupture to understand and prevent Achilles tendon injuries. Here we determined the pattern of rupture of an Achilles tendon (AT) in an elite high-jumper athlete who ruptured an AT during the straight line running phase in preparation for a high-jump attempt. This study is a novel case report regarding a national-level elite athlete. The main outcomes were kinematics parameters obtained from video analysis. The pattern of the rupture was determined by pixel intensity and outlier analysis. The rupture occurred at 44% of the single stance. The injured leg showed a higher ankle dorsal flexion and knee-ankle ratio, and a lower knee flexion compared to contralateral leg. An eccentric pattern of rupture occurred during the transition from the mid to terminal stance phases of running. The lower knee flexion and the increased ankle dorsal flexion during the stance suggest a loss of knee-ankle coordination. This might have favoured a major elongation of Achilles tendon causing the rupture."

A novel quadriceps tendon allograft with synthetic augmentation, or ""internal brace"" (QTIB), has been reported to have potential advantages for ACL reconstruction based on animal model data. In this preclinical canine comparison study, we hypothesized that QTIB allograft compared with pBTB autograft would provide superior durability for knee stability, function, and prevention of OA. Under approval from our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, adult purpose-bred research hounds (<i>n</i> = 10) underwent arthroscopic complete transection of the ACL followed by either an arthroscopic-assisted all-inside ACL reconstruction using the QTIB allograft (<i>n</i> = 5) or pBTB autograft (<i>n</i> = 5). Contralateral knees were used as nonoperated controls (<i>n</i> = 10). Radiographic and arthroscopic assessments were performed at 2 and 6 months, respectively, after surgery. Anterior drawer, internal rotation, lameness, kinetics, pain, effusion, and comfortable range of knee motion were measured at 2, 3, and 6 months. Biomechanical and histologic assessments were performed at 6 months. All reconstructed knees were stable and had intact ACL grafts 6 months after surgery. At 6 months, QTIB reconstructed knees had significantly less lameness, lower pain, less effusion, and increased range of motion when compared with BTB knees (<i>p</i> < 0.05). BTB knees had significantly higher radiographic OA scores than QTIB knees at 6 months (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Superior outcomes associated with QTIB allograft may be due to the lack of donor site morbidity, the use of a robust tendon graft, and/or protection of the graft from the synthetic augmentation. Robust tendon grafts combined with a synthetic internal brace and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) may allow for more rapid and robust tendon-bone healing and graft ""ligamentization,"" which protects the graft from early failure and rapid OA development that can plague commonly-used allografts."

Mutations in SLC39A14, encoding a Mn uptake transporter, have recently been recognized to cause excessive Mn concentrations in the blood which is believed to be neurotoxic and lead to a parkinsonian-like movement disorder caused by accumulation of Mn in the basal ganglia. We are reporting a new variant of SLC39A14 gene mutation (OMIM 608736 8p21.3) that has never been described in the literature so far. The index case is a 3-year-old female who was born at 30 weeks' gestation by emergency lower segment caesarean section, the second of twins, weighing 1.4 kg. Parents have a consanguineous marriage (first cousins) and have four healthy male children. She presented at 30 months of age with history of unsteady gait of 4 months duration and is progressively worsening. She became stiff and has lost all of her locomotor skills. Apart from low serum iron and iron deficiency anemia, her initial work up was unremarkable.

However, a limited number of studies have been performed to evaluate the toxicity of DM in the immune and nervous systems of animals. Here, we utilized a good vertebrate model, zebrafish, to evaluate the toxicity of DM during the developmental process. Exposure of zebrafish embryos to 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 mg/l DM from 6 h post fertilization (hpf) to 72 hpf induced developmental abnormalities, such as shorter body lengths and yolk sac edemas. The number of immune cells in zebrafish larvae was significantly reduced, but the inflammatory response was not influenced by DM treatment. The expression of immune-related genes were downregulated and the levels of oxidative stress were upregulated by DM exposure. Moreover, locomotor behaviors were inhibited by DM exposure. Therefore, our results suggest that DM has the potential to induce immunotoxicity and cause behavioral changes in zebrafish larvae. This study provides new evidence of the influence of DM exposure on aquatic ecosystems."

We fitted 59 adult subjects having myopia between -4.00D to -5.00D with overnight orthokeratology. Corneal biomechanics was measured through dynamic bidirectional corneal applanation (in terms of corneal hysteresis, CH and corneal resistance factor, CRF) and corneal indentation (in terms of corneal stiffness, S and tangent modulus, E). Subjects with poor orthokeratology responses had lower E (mean 0.474 MPa) than subjects with good orthokeratology responses (mean 0.536 MPa). Successful orthokeratology for 6 months resulted in reducing CH (reduced by 5.8%) and CRF (reduced by 8.7%). Corneal stiffness was stable, but E showed an increasing trend. Among subjects with successful orthokeratology, a higher baseline S resulted in greater myopia reduction (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.381, p = 0.02)."

Previous research has shown both gross motor skills and physical activity to be related to executive function. However, evidence for these relationships in the preschool years, as well as in low- and middle-income countries is lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationships between components of executive function (inhibition, shifting and working memory) and gross motor skills (locomotor skills and object control skills) in a sample of preschool children from urban and rural low-income settings in South Africa. Results revealed that inhibition and working memory, but not shifting, were associated with gross motor skills. More specifically: inhibition was associated with both locomotor [β = 0.20, p = 0.047] and object control skills [β = 0.24, p = 0.024], whereas working memory was only associated with locomotor skills [β = 0.21, p = 0.039]. Physical activity was not associated with inhibition and shifting but was negatively associated with working memory. These results elaborate a growing evidence base linking executive function and gross motor skills in the early years, and it is the first to look at specific associations of locomotor and object control skills with executive function in the South African context (a low- and middle-income country)."

Recent studies revealed that AVT also exerts central effects on behavior. The goldfish has several merits for evaluation of behavioral changes. However, there is few information on the behavioral action of AVT in this species. Here we examined the effects of AVT on food intake and psychomotor activity. AVT was administered intracerebroventricularly at 1, 5 and 10 pmol g<sup>-1</sup> body weight (BW). Intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of AVT at 5 and 10 pmol g<sup>-1</sup> BW significantly decreased food intake during 30 min after injection and recovery from anesthesia. The AVT-induced anorexigenic action was attenuated by treatment with the AVT receptor V1aR antagonist Manning compound (MC) at 50 pmol g<sup>-1</sup> BW. As the goldfish tends to prefer the lower to the upper area of a tank, we used this preference behavior for assessing psychomotor activity during a 30-min observation period. ICV administration of AVT at 1, 5 and 10 pmol g<sup>-1</sup> BW significantly prolonged the time spent in the lower area, but did not affect locomotor activity in the tank at any dose. The action of AVT was similar to that of the central-type benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist FG-7142 at 10 pmol g<sup>-1</sup> BW. AVT-induced anxiety-like behavior was blocked by treatment with MC at 50 pmol g<sup>-1</sup> BW. These results indicate that AVT affects food intake and psychophysiological status, and also induces anorexigenic- and anxiogenic-like actions via the V1aR-signaling pathway in the goldfish brain."

For the latter, commercially available plate - endoprosthesis assemblies require contouring, to be adapted to the patient's bone geometry, and lead to sub-optimal results. The use of additively-manufactured personalized endoprostheses and cutting guides for distal radius limb-sparing surgery in dogs presents a promising alternative. Specialized software is used for the bone structure reconstruction from the patient's CT scans and for the design of endoprostheses and cutting guides. The prostheses are manufactured from a titanium alloy using a laser powder bed fusion system, while the cutting guides are manufactured from an ABS plastic using a fused deposition modeling system. A finite element model of an instrumented limb was developed and validated using experimental testing of a cadaveric limb implanted with a personalized endoprosthesis. Personalized endoprostheses and cutting guides can reduce limb sparing surgery time by 25-50% and may reduce the risk of implant failure. The numerical model was validated using the kinematics and force-displacement diagrams of the implant-limb construct. The model indicated that a modulus of elasticity of an implant material ranging from 25 to 50 GPa would improve the stress distribution within the implant. The results of the current study will allow optimization of the design of the personal implants in both veterinary and human patients."

Numerous knee kinematic models of different complexity, with either generic or subject-specific anatomy, have been presented and used to predict three-dimensional tibiofemoral (TFJ) and patellofemoral (PFJ) joint kinematics of cadavers or healthy adults, but not pediatric populations. The aims of this study were: (i) to develop subject-specific TFJ and PFJ kinematic models, with TFJ models having either rigid or extensible ligament constraints, for eight healthy pediatric participants and (ii) to validate the estimated joint and ligament kinematics against in vivo kinematics measured from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at four TFJ flexion angles. Three different TFJ models were created from MRIs and used to solve the TFJ kinematics: (i) 5-rigid-link parallel mechanism with rigid surface contact and isometric anterior cruciate (ACL), posterior cruciate (PCL) and medial collateral (MCL) ligaments (ΔL<sub>null</sub>), (ii) 6-link parallel mechanism with minimized ACL, PCL, MCL and lateral collateral ligament (LCL) length changes (ΔL<sub>min</sub>) and (iii) 6-link parallel mechanism with prescribed ACL, PCL, MCL and LCL length variations (ΔL<sub>match</sub>). Each model's geometrical parameters were optimized using a Multiple Objective Particle Swarm algorithm. When compared to MRI-measured data, ΔL<sub>null</sub> and ΔL<sub>match</sub> performed the best, with average root mean square errors below 6.93° and 4.23 mm for TFJ and PFJ angles and displacements, respectively, and below 2.01 mm for ligament lengths (<4.32% ligament strain). Therefore, within these error ranges, ΔL<sub>null</sub> and ΔL<sub>match</sub> can be used to estimate three-dimensional pediatric TFJ, PFJ and ligament kinematics and can be incorporated into lower-limb models to estimate joint kinematics and kinetics during dynamic tasks."

For delineation of spatially resolved distribution of corneal elasticity, high-resolution elastography system is required. In this study, we demonstrate a high-resolution elastography system using high-frequency ultrasound for ex-vivo measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP)-dependent corneal wave speed. Tone bursts of 500 Hz vibrations were generated on the corneal surface using an electromagnetic shaker. A 35-MHz single-element transducer was used to track the resulting anti-symmetrical Lamb wave in the cornea. We acquired spatially resolved wave speed images of the cornea at IOPs of 7, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 29 mmHg. The IOP dependence of corneal wave speed is apparent from these images. Statistical analysis of measured wave speed as a function of IOP revealed a linear relation between wave speed and IOP <i>c<sub>s</sub></i> = 0.37 + 0.22 × IOP, with the coefficient of determination <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.86. We also observed depth-dependent variations of wave speed in the cornea, decreasing from anterior toward posterior. This depth dependence is more pronounced at higher IOP values. This study demonstrates the potential of high-frequency ultrasound elastography in the characterization of spatially resolved corneal biomechanical properties."

The datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and genes (DEGs) were accessed by R. Targets of DEMs and predicted using starBase, and functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed using Metascape. A protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network and an analysis of modules were constructed using NetworkAnalyst. Finally, a network was constructed to show the regulatory association between transcription factors (TFs), DEMs and downstream genes. A total of 5 DEMs were found both in GSE97070 and GSE40807, including 3 upregulated DEMs and 2 downregulated DEMs. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses from Metascape revealed that the target genes of upregulated DEMs were significantly enriched in adherens junction, kinase and protein binding, while the target genes of downregulated DEMs were mainly involved in non‑canonical Wnt signaling pathway and RNA transport. From the PPI network, 13 nodes were screened as hub genes. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the top 5 modules were mostly enriched in the neurotrophin signaling pathway, mRNA surveillance pathway and MAPK signaling pathway. In addition, the TF‑DEMs‑target gene and DEGs regulatory network revealed that 17 TFs regulated 2 miRNAs, including upregulated or downregulated DEMs, CREB1 regulated all upregulated DEMs, and TGFB1 was an activator of hsa‑miR‑199a‑3p and a repressor of hsa‑miR‑429. Taken together, the present study identified several miRNAs and potential biological mechanisms involved in the tumorigenesis of MTC.

While mitral valve mechanics have been studied for many decades, traditional testing methods limit the spatial resolution of measurements and can be destructive. Optical coherence elastography (OCE) is an emerging method for measuring viscoelastic properties of tissues in a noninvasive, nondestructive manner. In this study, we employed air-pulse OCE to measure the spatial variation in mitral valve elastic properties with micro-scale resolution at 1 mm increments along the radial length of the leaflets. We analyzed differences between the leaflets, as well as between regions of the valve. We found that the anterior leaflet has a higher elastic wave velocity, which is reported as a surrogate for stiffness, than the posterior leaflet, most notably at the annular edge of the sample. In addition, we found a spatial elastic gradient in the anterior leaflet, where the annular edge was found to have a greater elastic wave velocity than the free edge. This gradient was less pronounced in the posterior leaflet. These patterns were confirmed using established uniaxial tensile testing methods. Overall, the anterior leaflet was stiffer and had greater heterogeneity in its mechanical properties than the posterior leaflet. This study measures differences between the two mitral leaflets with greater resolution than previously feasible and demonstrates a method that may be suitable for assessing valve mechanics following repair or during the engineering of synthetic valve replacements."

We aim to bioengineer a microfibre-reinforced hydrogel that can capture the zonal depth-dependent mechanical properties of native cartilage, and simultaneously support neo-cartilage formation. With this goal, a sophisticated bi-layered microfibre architecture, combining a densely distributed crossed fibre mat (superficial tangential zone, STZ) and a uniform box structure (middle and deep zone, MDZ), was successfully manufactured via melt electrospinning and combined with a gelatin-methacrylamide hydrogel. The inclusion of a thin STZ layer greatly increased the composite construct's peak modulus under both incongruent (3.2-fold) and congruent (2.1-fold) loading, as compared to hydrogels reinforced with only a uniform MDZ structure. Notably, the stress relaxation response of the bi-layered composite construct was comparable to the tested native cartilage tissue. Furthermore, similar production of sulphated glycosaminoglycans and collagen II was observed for the novel composite constructs cultured under mechanical conditioning w/o TGF-ß1 supplementation and in static conditions w/TGF-ß1 supplementation, which confirmed the capability of the novel composite construct to support neo-cartilage formation upon mechanical stimulation. To conclude, these results are an important step towards the design and manufacture of biomechanically competent implants for cartilage regeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Damage to articular cartilage results in severe pain and joint disfunction that cannot be treated with currently available implants. This study presents a sophisticated bioengineered bi-layered fibre reinforced cell-laden hydrogel that can approximate the functional mechanical properties of native cartilage. For the first time, the importance of incorporating a viable superficial tangential zone (STZ) - like structure to improve the load-bearing properties of bioengineered constructs, particularly when in-congruent surfaces are compressed, is demonstrated.

They were divided into four groups: the normal group, bilateral keratoconus (BK) group, unilateral keratoconus (UK) group, and the forme fruste keratoconus (FFK) group. After determining the BADD, CBI, and TBI for each eye using the Corvis ST combined with Pentacam, the sensitivity and specificity of these three indices in diagnosing keratoconus were analyzed through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. <b>Results</b>: The TBI exhibited the highest diagnostic efficiency in normal vs. UK (area under the ROC curve [AUROC]: 0.992), normal vs. UK+BK (AUROC: 0.988), normal vs. UK+BK* (*stand randomly selecting one eye of each patient in BK group) (AUROC: 0.982), normal vs. UK+BK+FFK (AUROC: 0.965), and normal vs. UK+BK*+FFK (AUROC: 0.953). The CBI demonstrated the highest diagnostic efficiency in normal vs. FFK (AUROC: 0.897). Finally, the BADD showed the highest diagnostic efficiency in normal vs. BK (AUROC: 0.998) and normal vs. BK* (AUROC: 0.996). <b>Conclusion</b>: The BADD, CBI, and TBI performed well in diagnosing keratoconus in Chinese myopic eyes. The CBI showed the highest diagnostic efficiency compared with normal for FFK. In addition, the TBI offered the greatest accuracy in detecting keratoconus and FFK eyes vs. the other parameters."

Prospective, non-randomized study. A total of 80 eyes from 80 patients were treated with either SMILE or FS-LASIK. Parameters of inverse concave radius, deformation amplitude ratio 2 mm or 1 mm (DA ratio 2 mm or 1 mm), highest concavity radius (HC radius), biomechanically corrected intraocular pressure (bIOP), and central corneal thickness (CCT) measured by Corvis ST II were recorded at 1 day preoperatively, immediately after the lenticule or flap creation, during subsequent lenticule extraction or excimer laser ablation, and during follow-up at 1 week, 1 month and 3 months postoperatively. After lenticule creation, the DA ratio 2 mm or 1 mm was bigger (p < 0.05), meanwhile, CCT was thicker (p < 0.05) than with flap creation. Partial parameters changed significantly after lenticule creation or flap creation, and all parameters changed significantly after tissue removal. All parameters showed no significant differences between the two groups (p > 0.05) after operation. The variations in bIOP (ΔbIOP) after operation were significantly less than those in Δnon-contact IOP (p < 0.001) in two groups. Femtosecond laser cutting during lenticule creation has a greater impact on corneal biomechanics than flap creation. Both the femtosecond laser cutting and removal of tissue degrade corneal biomechanics; however, these effects may be predominantly a result of tissue removal. SMILE and FS-LASIK have no differences in corneal biomechanics when the same CCT is consumed. bIOP is more reliable after the operation, but further study is essential."

The mechanical behaviour of living matter is governed not only by an elastic or viscoelastic response to loading on short time scales up to several minutes, but also by often crucial growth and remodelling responses on time scales from hours to months. Phenomena of growth and remodelling play important roles, for example during morphogenesis in early life as well as in homeostasis and pathogenesis in adult tissues, which often adapt to changes in their chemo-mechanical environment as a result of ageing, diseases, injury or surgical intervention. Mechano-regulated growth and remodelling are observed in various soft tissues, ranging from tendons and arteries to the eye and brain, but also in bone, lower organisms and plants. Understanding and predicting growth and remodelling of living systems is one of the most important challenges in biomechanics and mechanobiology. This article reviews the current state of growth and remodelling as it applies primarily to soft tissues, and provides a perspective on critical challenges and future directions."

By Raman spectroscopy, we detected an earlier formation of mineralized extracellular matrix (ECM) of higher quality under serum-free media conditions. However, mineralization potential remained too low. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the biochemical composition and subsequent biomechanical properties of the JPC-formed ECM and minerals under human platelet lysate (hPL) and FCS supplementation. JPCs were isolated (<i>n</i> = 4 donors) and expanded under FCS conditions and used in passage five for osteogenic induction under both, FCS and hPL media supplementation. Raman spectroscopy and Alizarin Red/von Kossa staining were employed for biochemical composition analyses and for visualization and quantification of mineralization. Osteocalcin gene expression was analyzed by quantitative PCR. Biomechanical properties were assessed by using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Raman spectroscopic measurements showed significantly higher (<i>p</i> < 0.001) phosphate to protein ratios and in the tendency, lower carbonate to phosphate ratios in osteogenically induced JPCs under hPL in comparison to FCS culturing. Furthermore, higher crystal sizes were detected under hPL culturing of the cells. With respect to the ECM, significantly higher ratios of the precursor protein proline to hydroxyproline were detected in hPL-cultured JPC monolayers (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Additionally, significantly higher levels (<i>p</i> < 0.001) of collagen cross-linking were calculated, indicating a higher degree of collagen maturation in hPL-cultured JPCs. By atomic force microscopy, a significant increase in ECM stiffness (<i>p</i> < 0.001) of FCS cultured JPC monolayers was observed. The reverse effect was measured for the JPC formed precipitates/minerals. Under hPL supplementation, JPCs formed minerals of significantly higher stiffness (<i>p</i> < 0.001) when compared to the FCS setting. This study demonstrates that hPL culturing of JPCs leads to the formation of an anorganic material of superior quality in terms of biochemical composition and mechanical properties."

Tendon or enthesis scaffolds have been widely studied, but few of these materials can recapitulate the tissue continuity. Thus, this study is conducted to prepare a triphasic decellularized bone-fibrocartilage-tendon (D-BFT) composite scaffold. The D-BFT scaffold is developed using a combination of physical, chemical, and enzymatic treatments using liquid nitrogen, Triton-X 100, sodium-dodecyl sulfate, and DNase I, which effectively removes the cell components while preserving the biological composite and microstructure. Moreover, the mechanical properties of D-BFT are highly preserved and similar to those of the human Achilles tendon. Additionally, in vitro, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) adhered, proliferated, and infiltrated into the D-BFT scaffold, and MSC differentiation is confirmed by up-regulation of osteogenic-related and tenogenic-related genes. The repair outcomes are explored by applying the D-BFT scaffold in the model of femur-tibia defects in vivo, which shows good repair results. Thus, the D-BFT scaffold developed in this study is a promising graft for enthesis regeneration."

Currently, it is highly challenging to generate vasculature integrated with smooth muscle and endothelium that replicates the complexity and functionality of natural vessels. Here, a novel method for directly printing self-standing, small-diameter vasculature with smooth muscle and endothelium is presented through combining tailored mussel-inspired bioink and unique ""fugitive-migration"" tactics, and its effectiveness and advantages over other methods (i.e., traditional alginate/calcium hydrogel, post-perfusion of endothelial cells) are demonstrated. The biologically inspired, catechol-functionalized, gelatin methacrylate (GelMA/C) undergoes rapid oxidative crosslinking in situ to form an elastic hydrogel, which can be engineered with controllable mechanical strength, high cell/tissue adhesion, and excellent bio-functionalization. The results demonstrate the bioprinted vascular construct possessed numerous favorable, biomimetic characteristics such as proper biomechanics, higher tissue affinity, vascularized tissue manufacturing ability, beneficial perfusability and permeability, excellent vasculoactivity, and in vivo autonomous connection (~2 weeks) as well as vascular remodeling (~6 weeks). The advanced achievements in creating biomimetic, functional vasculature illustrate significant potential toward fabricating small-diameter vasculature and eventually generating a complicated vascularized tissue/organ for clinic translation."

However, the processing difficulty and poor osteoinductive ability greatly limit the application of HA. Although many strategies have been reported to improve the machinability and osteointegration ability, the performance including mechanical strength, porosity, cell adhesion, <i>etc.</i> of material still can not meet the requirements. In this work, a soft template method was developed and a porous scaffold with hierarchical pore structure, nano surface morphology, suitable porosity and pore size, and good biomechanical strength was successfully prepared. The hierarchical pore structure is beneficial for cell adhesion, fluid transfer, and cell ingrowth. Moreover, the loaded reduced graphene oxide (rGO) can improve the adhesion and promote the proliferation and spontaneous osteogenic differentiation bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. The scaffold is then crushed, degraded and wrapped by the newly formed bone and the newly formed bone gradually replaces the scaffold. The degradation rate of the scaffold well matches the rate of the new bone formation. The hierarchical porous HA/rGO composite scaffolds can greatly accelerate the bone ingrowth in the scaffold and bone repair in critical bone defects, thus providing a clinical potential candidate for large segment bone tissue engineering."

Soy contains isoflavones, which are estrogenic. Therefore, soy-containing animal diets might influence estrogen-regulated systems, including basal behavioral domains, as well as affective behavior and cognition. Furthermore, the isoflavone content of soy varies, potentially unpredictably confounding behavioral results. Therefore researchers are increasingly considering completely avoiding dietary soy to circumvent this problem. Several animal studies have investigated the effects of soy free diets but produced inconsistent results. In addition, most of these previous studies were performed in outbred rat or mouse strains. In the current study, we assessed whether a soy-free diet altered locomotion, exploration, nesting, anxiety-related behaviors, learning, and memory in C57BL/6 mice, the most common inbred strain used in biomedical research. The parameters evaluated address measures of basic health, natural behavior, and affective state that also are landmarks for animal welfare. Wefound minor differences between feeding groups but no indications of altered welfare. We therefore suggest that a soy-free diet can be used as a standard diet to prevent undesirable side effects of isoflavones and to further optimize diet standardization, quality assurance, and ultimately increase the reproducibility of experiments."

However, the biomechanical characteristics of these materials are often not validated against those of human bones. Thus, synthetic bone surrogates reflecting procedure-specific biomechanical properties of human bones are necessary for reliable implant design and testing. The aim of this study was to evaluate novel custom made open- and close-cell bone surrogates through morphometry assessment and pedicle screw pullout tests as an alternative to human bone for biomechanical testing. Bone surrogates created from polyurethane resin, mineral fillers and varying amounts of blowing agent were customized to various densities. Pedicle screws were manually inserted and pullout tests with a feed rate of 1 mm/min were conducted until failure. Load and displacement curves were recorded and analyzed in terms of maximum pullout forces. The resulting pullout forces of open- (1437 ± 665 N) and close-cell surrogates (951 ± 578 N) showed comparable results to human bone (1417 ± 812N) used as a reference. Furthermore, structural morphometric parameters were in accordance with human vertebral cancellous bone. In conclusion, the customized bone surrogates provide a new opportunity to design and test pedicle screws and further study the relationship between biomechanical properties and apparent density of artificial spongy bone."

In the two-bottle free choice paradigm, GAL<sub>3</sub> -KO mice consistently showed a significantly increased preference for ethanol over water when compared to wildtype littermates. Furthermore, male GAL<sub>3</sub> -KO mice displayed significantly increased responding for ethanol under operant conditions. These differences in alcohol seeking behavior in GAL<sub>3</sub> -KO mice did not result from altered ethanol metabolism. In contrast to ethanol, GAL<sub>3</sub> -KO mice exhibited similar preference for saccharin and sucrose over water, and a similar preference for a high fat diet over a low fat diet as wildtype littermates. No differences in cognitive and locomotor behaviors were observed in GAL<sub>3</sub> -KO mice to account for increased alcohol seeking behavior. Overall, these findings suggest genetic ablation of GAL<sub>3</sub> in mice increases alcohol consumption."
