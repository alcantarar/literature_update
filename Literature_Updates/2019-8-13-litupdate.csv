Compared to women, osteoporosis in men is associated with greater morbidity and mortality. In this study, we conducted tomographic and biomechanical evaluations of trabecular and cortical bone in the early stage of male osteoporosis. Male Wistar rats were subjected to orchiectomy and sham operation. Four weeks after being castrated, decreased levels of testosterone in plasma were found and resulted in concurrent bone loss. Separately, the orchiectomy led to significant tomographic alterations in the trabecular bone number, trabecular separation, and trabecular pattern factor. Data of a mechanistic compression test further showed that the orchiectomy diminished the maximum loading force, displacement at maximum load, energy at maximum load, and ultimate stress. Interestingly, orchiectomy-triggered changes in the maximum loading force and tomographic parameters were highly correlated. In contrast, tomographic and biomechanical analyses showed that 4 weeks after rats were orchiectomized, the thickness, area, maximum loading force, bone stiffness, energy at maximum load, and ultimate stress of the cortical bone were not changed. Taken together, this study showed specific differences in the microarchitecture and strength of trabecular bone in the early stage of male osteoporosis."

Phenotypes of osteocalcin knock-out mice (OC-/-) may vary on different backgrounds and with sex. Previous studies using adult female (OC-/-) mice on a mixed genetic background (129/B6) showed osteocalcin inhibited bone formation leading to weaker bone in wild-type (OC+/+). Yet on a pure (B6) genetic background male mice revealed osteocalcin improved fracture resistance and OC-/- bones were more prone to fracture. Osteocalcin is decreased with age and in some diseases (diabetes) where bone weakness is observed. The effect of osteocalcin in adult female bone from mice on a pure B6 background is unknown. We investigated differences in bone mineral properties and bone strength in female adult (6 months) (OC+/+) and (OC-/-) mice on a pure C57BL/6J background using Fourier Transform Infrared Imaging (FTIRI), micro-computed tomography (uCT), biomechanical measurements, histomorphometry and serum turnover markers (P1NP, CTX). Similar to female age matched mice on the (129/C57) background we found B6 OC-/- mice had a higher bone formation rate, no change in bone resorption, more immature mineral, decreased crystallinity and increased trabecular bone as compared to OC+/+. In contrast, the OC-/- mice on a pure B6 background had a lower bone mineral density, lower mineral to matrix ratio resulting in reduced stiffness and weaker bone strength. Our results demonstrate some properties of the OC-/- phenotype are dependent on genetic background. This may suggest that reduced osteocalcin may contribute to fracture and weaker bone in some groups of elderly and adults with diseases where osteocalcin is low."

Incidences range from 5 to 40% in high-risk patients, such as patients with periosteal damage. The periosteum is essential in adequate fracture healing, especially during soft callus formation. In this study, we hypothesize that inducing periosteal damage in a murine bone healing model will result in a novel delayed union model."

Muscle-specific changes in morphology in early ageing may differ between locomotor and respiratory muscles. To investigate this, we compared capillarization, fiber type composition, fiber cross-sectional area (FCSA) and oxidative capacity of individual fibers of the soleus (n = 6/5 for 20- and 79 weeks, respectively), extensor digitorum longus (EDL: n = 3/3) and diaphragm (n = 7/5) muscles in 20- (mature) and 79-week-old (early ageing) CD-1 female mice. There was no significant loss of soleus and EDL mass. The FCSA was larger and the capillary density lower at 79 than 20 weeks in the diaphragm, while in the EDL the opposite was found (both p ≤ 0.002) with no significant ageing-related differences in the soleus. The heterogeneity in capillary spacing, which may negatively impact on muscle oxygenation, was highest in muscles from 20-week-old mice, irrespective of muscle (p ≤ 0.011). Succinate dehydrogenase activity, indicative of oxidative capacity, and capillary to fiber ratio did not significantly change with age in any muscle. At all ages, the capillary supply to a fiber was positively related to FCSA in each muscle. We conclude that despite previously reported early age-related reductions in specific tension in both locomotor and respiratory muscles, morphological changes show a muscle-specific pattern in early ageing CD-1 mice. Specifically, early ageing was associated with 1) diaphragm hypertrophy 2) and fiber atrophy in the EDL that was not accompanied by angiogenesis, capillary rarefaction or reductions in oxidative capacity."

A decisive step for the prevention and medical treatment of atherosclerosis is to predict what conditions determine whether early atherosclerotic plaques continue to grow, stagnate or become regressive. The driving biological and mechanobiological mechanisms that determine the stability of plaques are yet not fully understood. We develop a spatially resolved and quantitative mathematical model of key contributors of early atherosclerosis. The stability of atherosclerotic model plaques is assessed to identify and classify progression-prone and progression-resistant atherosclerotic regions based on measurable or computable in vivo inputs, such as blood cholesterol concentrations and wall shear stresses. The model combines Darcy's law for the transmural flow through vessels walls, the Kedem-Katchalsky equations for endothelial fluxes of lipoproteins, a quantitative model of early plaque formation from a recent publication and a novel submodel for macrophage recruitment. The parameterization and analysis of the model suggest that the advective flux of lipoproteins through the endothelium is decisive, while the influence of the advective transport within the artery wall is negligible. Further, regions in arteries with an approximate wall shear stress exposure below 20% of the average exposure and their surroundings are potential regions where progression-prone atherosclerotic plaques develop."

To this end we have engineered the β-wrapin AS69 to bind monomeric α-synuclein with high affinity. In cultured cells, AS69 reduced the self-interaction of α-synuclein and the formation of visible α-synuclein aggregates. In flies, AS69 reduced α-synuclein aggregates and the locomotor deficit resulting from α-synuclein expression in neuronal cells. In biophysical experiments in vitro, AS69 highly sub-stoichiometrically inhibited both primary and autocatalytic secondary nucleation processes, even in the presence of a large excess of monomer. We present evidence that the AS69-α-synuclein complex, rather than the free AS69, is the inhibitory species responsible for sub-stoichiometric inhibition of secondary nucleation. These results represent a new paradigm that high affinity monomer binders can lead to strongly sub-stoichiometric inhibition of nucleation processes."

Interdisciplinary approaches, combining various complementary techniques, especially those operating at a nanoscale level, potentially accelerate characterization of cancer cells or tissue properties. Here, we study a relation between the surface and biomechanical properties of melanoma cells, measured by mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). In total, seven cell lines have been studied. Six of them were melanoma cells derived from various stages of tumor progression: (1) WM115 cells derived from a 55 year old female skin melanoma at a vertical growth phase (VGP) in the primary melanoma site, (2) WM793 cells established from the vertical growth phase (VGP) of a primary skin melanoma lesion, (3) WM266-4 cells established from a cutaneous skin metastasis detected in the same patient as WM115 cells, (4) WM239 cells derived from a cutaneous skin metastasis, (5) 1205Lu cells originated from a lung metastasis diagnosed in the same patient as WM793 cells, and (6) A375P-cells were derived from a solid malignant tumor located in the lung. As a reference cell line, human epidermal melanocytes from adult skin (primary cell line HEMa-LP) were used. Results reveal low, medium, and large deformability of melanoma cells originating from vertical growth phase (VGP), and skin and lung metastasis, respectively. These changes were accompanied by distinct outcome from principal component analysis (PCA). In relation to VGP melanoma cells, cells from skin and lung metastasis reveal similar or significantly different surface properties. The largest deformability difference observed for cells from VGP and lung metastasis was accompanied by the largest separation of unspecific changes in their surface properties. In this way, we show the evidence that biomechanical and surface biochemical properties of cells change in parallel, indicating a potential of being used as nanobiophysical fingerprints of melanoma progression."

Procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2 (PLOD2) encodes the only lysyl hydroxylase (LH) isoform that specifically hydroxylates lysine residues in collagen telopeptides, a post-translational modification required for the formation of stabilized cross-links. PLOD2 expression is induced by hypoxia and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), well-known stimuli for the formation of a fibrotic ECM, which can lead to pathological fibrosis underlying several diseases. Here, using human and murine fibroblasts, we studied the molecular determinants underlying hypoxia- and TGF-β1-induced PLOD2 expression and its impact on collagen biosynthesis. Deletion mapping and mutagenesis analysis identified specific binding sites for hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) and TGF-β1-activated SMAD proteins on the human <i>PLOD2</i> gene promoter that were required for these stimuli to induce <i>PLOD2</i> expression. Interestingly, our experiments also revealed that HIF signaling plays a preponderant role over the SMAD pathway, as intact HIF sites were absolutely required for TGF-β1 to exert its effect on SMAD binding sites. We also found that silencing <i>PLOD2</i> expression did not alter soluble collagen accumulation in the extracellular medium, but it effectively abolished the deposition into the insoluble collagen matrix. Taken together, our findings reveal the existence of a hierarchical relationship between the HIF and SMAD signaling pathways for hypoxia- and TGF-β1-mediated regulation of <i>PLOD2</i> expression, a key event in the deposition of collagen into the ECM."

To perform these tasks, cells spatiotemporally coordinate the interactions of force-generating, 'active' molecules that create and manipulate non-equilibrium structures and force fields of up to millimetre length scales<sup>1-3</sup>. Experimental active-matter systems of biological or synthetic molecules are capable of spontaneously organizing into structures<sup>4,5</sup> and generating global flows<sup>6-9</sup>. However, these experimental systems lack the spatiotemporal control found in cells, limiting their utility for studying non-equilibrium phenomena and bioinspired engineering. Here we uncover non-equilibrium phenomena and principles of boundary-mediated control by optically modulating structures and fluid flow in an engineered system of active biomolecules. Our system consists of purified microtubules and light-activatable motor proteins that crosslink and organize the microtubules into distinct structures upon illumination. We develop basic operations-defined as sets of light patterns-to create, move and merge the microtubule structures. By combining these operations, we create microtubule networks that span several hundred micrometres in length and contract at speeds up to an order of magnitude higher than the speed of an individual motor protein. We manipulate these contractile networks to generate and sculpt persistent fluid flows. The principles of boundary-mediated control that we uncover may be used to study emergent cellular structures and forces and to develop programmable active-matter devices."

Despite drugs are used to treat the disease clinically, the influence of these drugs on leukemia cells' biomechanical properties, which are closely related to complications like leukostasis or infiltration, is still unclear. Due to non-adherent and viscoelastic nature of leukemia cells, accurate measurement of their elastic modulus is still a challenging issue. In this study, we adopted rate-jump method together with optical tweezers indentation to accurately measure elastic modulus of leukemia cells K562 after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), Cytoxan (CTX), and Dexamethasone (DEX) treatment, respectively. We found that compared to control sample, K562 cells treated by PMA showed nearly a threefold increase in elastic modulus. Transwell experiment results suggested that the K562 cells treated with PMA have the lowest migration capability. Besides, it was shown that the cytoskeleton protein gene α-tubulin and vimentin have a significant increase in expression after PMA treatment by qPCR. The results indicate that PMA has a significant influence on protein expression, stiffness, and migration ability of the leukemia cell K562, and may also play an important role in the leukostasis in leukemia."

It glides on substrates propelled by beating cilia on its lower surface and periodically pauses to feed on underlying microorganisms, which it digests externally. Here, a combination of advanced electron and light microscopic techniques are used to take a closer look at its secretory cell types and their roles in locomotion and feeding. We identify digestive enzymes in lipophils, a cell type implicated in external digestion and distributed uniformly throughout the ventral epithelium except for a narrow zone near its edge. We find three morphologically distinct types of gland cell. The most prevalent contains and secretes mucus, which is shown to be involved in adhesion and gliding. Half of the mucocytes are arrayed in a tight row around the edge of the ventral epithelium while the rest are scattered further inside, in the region containing lipophils. The secretory granules in mucocytes at the edge label with an antibody against a neuropeptide that was reported to arrest ciliary beating during feeding. A second type of gland cell is arrayed in a narrow row just inside the row of mucocytes while a third is located more centrally. Our maps of the positions of the structurally distinct secretory cell types provide a foundation for further characterization of the multiple peptidergic cell types in <i>Trichoplax</i> and the microscopic techniques we introduce provide tools for carrying out these studies."

During desiccation, the exocarp shrinks and splits open, and subsequent endocarp deformation is a complex three-dimensional shape change, including formation of dehiscence lines, opening of the apical part and formation of a constriction at the middle part. Owing to the constriction forming, mechanical pressure is increasingly applied on the seed until ejection. We describe a structural latch system consisting of connective cellular structures between endocarp and seed, which break with a distinct cracking sound upon ejection. A maximum seed velocity of 12.3 m s<sup>-1</sup>, maximum launch acceleration of 19 853 m s<sup>-2</sup> (approx. 2000g) and maximum seed rotational velocity of 25 714 min<sup>-1</sup> were measured. We argue that miniscule morphological differences between the inner endocarp surface and seed, which features a notable ridge, are responsible for putting spin on the seed. This hypothesis is further corroborated by the observation that there is no preferential seed rotation direction among fruits. Our findings show that H. mollis has evolved similar mechanisms for stabilizing a 'shot out' seed as humans use for stabilizing rifle bullets and are discussed in an ecological (dispersal biology), biomechanical (seed ballistics) and functional-morphological (fine-tuning and morphospace of functional endocarps) contexts, and promising additional aspects for future studies are proposed."

Because they can jump higher without them.,"As animals get smaller, their ability to generate usable work from muscle contraction is decreased by the muscle's force-velocity properties, thereby reducing their effective jump height. Very small animals use a spring-actuated system, which prevents velocity effects from reducing available energy. Since force-velocity properties reduce the usable work in even larger animals, why don't larger animals use spring-actuated jumping systems as well? We will show that muscle length-tension properties limit spring-actuated systems to generating a maximum 1/3 of the possible work that a muscle could produce - greatly restricting the jumping height of spring-actuated jumpers. Thus a spring-actuated jumping animal has a jumping height that is 1/3 of the maximum possible jump height achievable were 100% of the possible muscle work available. Larger animals, which could theoretically use all of the available muscle energy, have a maximum jumping height that asymptotically approaches a value that is about 3 times higher than that of spring-actuated jumpers. Furthermore, a size related 'crossover point' is evident for these two jumping mechanisms: animals smaller than this point can jump higher with a spring-actuated mechanism, while animals larger than this point can jump higher with a muscle-actuated mechanism. We demonstrate how this limit on energy storage is a consequence of the interaction between length-tension properties of muscles and spring stiffness. We indicate where this crossover point occurs based on modelling and then use jumping data from the literature to validate that larger jumping animals generate greater jump heights with muscle-actuated systems than spring-actuated systems."

We examined the kinematics, energetics and morphology of long-distance jumps produced by the legless larvae of gall midges (<i>Asphondylia</i> sp.). They store elastic energy by forming their body into a loop and pressurizing part of their body to form a transient 'leg'. They prevent movement during elastic loading by placing two regions covered with microstructures against each other, which likely serve as a newly described adhesive latch. Once the latch releases, the transient 'leg' launches the body into the air. Their average takeoff speeds (mean: 0.85 m s<sup>-1</sup>; range: 0.39-1.27 m s<sup>-1</sup>) and horizontal travel distances (up to 36 times body length or 121 mm) rival those of legged insect jumpers and their mass-specific power density (mean: 910 W kg<sup>-1</sup>; range: 150-2420 W kg<sup>-1</sup>) indicates the use of elastic energy storage to launch the jump. Based on the forces reported for other microscale adhesive structures, the adhesive latching surfaces are sufficient to oppose the loading forces prior to jumping. Energetic comparisons of insect larval crawling versus jumping indicate that these jumps are orders of magnitude more efficient than would be possible if the animals had crawled an equivalent distance. These discoveries integrate three vibrant areas in engineering and biology - soft robotics, small, high-acceleration systems, and adhesive systems - and point toward a rich, and as-yet untapped area of biological diversity of worm-like, small, legless jumpers."

Here, we compared self-righting strategies of the Madagascar hissing, American and discoid cockroaches on a challenging flat, rigid, low-friction surface to quantify the mechanical principles. All three species almost always self-righted (97% probability) when given time (30 s), frequently self-righted (63%) on the first attempt, and on that attempt did so in 1 s or less. When successful, two of the three species gained and used pitch and/or roll rotational kinetic energy to overcome potential energy barriers (American 63% of all attempts and discoid 78%). By contrast, the largest, heaviest, wingless cockroach (Madagascar hissing) relied far less on the energy of motion and was the slowest to self-right. Two of the three species used rolling strategies to overcome low potential energy barriers. Successful righting attempts had greater rolling rotation than failed attempts as the center of mass rose to the highest position. Madagascar hissing cockroaches rolled using body deformation (98% of all trials) and the American cockroach rolled using leg forces (93%). By contrast, the discoid cockroach overcame higher and a wider range of potential energy barriers with simultaneous pitching and rolling using the wings (46% of all trials) and legs (49%) equally to self-right. Our quantification revealed the performance advantages of using rotational kinetic energy to overcome the potential energy barrier and rolling more to lower it, while maintaining diverse strategies for ground-based self-righting."

These organisms store energy in elastic structures (e.g. springs) and then rapidly release it using latches, such that movement is driven by the rapid conversion of stored elastic to kinetic energy using springs, with the dynamics of this conversion mediated by latches. Initially drawn to these systems by an interest in the muscle power limits of small jumping insects, biologists established the idea of power amplification, which refers both to a measurement technique and to a conceptual framework defined by the mechanical power output of a system exceeding muscle limits. However, the field of fast elastically driven movements has expanded to encompass diverse biological and synthetic systems that do not have muscles - such as the surface tension catapults of fungal spores and launches of plant seeds. Furthermore, while latches have been recognized as an essential part of many elastic systems, their role in mediating the storage and release of elastic energy from the spring is only now being elucidated.

This study utilizes longitudinal clinical image data to establish a self-validating time-dependent finite element (FE)-based remodeling procedure to explore the effects of different buccal bone thicknesses on long-term bone remodeling outcomes in silico. Based upon the clinical computed tomography (CT) scans, a patient-specific heterogeneous FE model was constructed to enable virtual BBT augmentation at four different levels (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm), followed by investigation into the bone remodeling behavior of the different case scenarios. The findings indicated that although peri-implant bone resorption decreased with increasing initial BBT from 0.5 to 2 mm, different levels of the reduction in bone loss were associated with the amount of bone augmentation. In the case of 0.5 mm BBT, overloading resorption was triggered during the first 18 months, but such bone resorption was delayed when the BBT increased to 1.5 mm. It was found that when the BBT reached a threshold thickness of 1.5 mm, the bone volume can be better preserved. This finding agrees with the consensus in dental clinic, in which 1.5 mm BBT is considered clinically justifiable for surgical requirement of bone graft. In conclusion, this study introduced a self-validating bone remodeling algorithm in silico, and it divulged that the initial BBT affects the bone remodeling outcome significantly, and a sufficient initial BBT is considered essential to assure long-term stability and success of implant treatment."

The atlas-axis complex is a mammalian innovation that allows precise head movements during these behaviors. While morphological variation in other vertebral regions has been linked to ecological differences in mammals, less is known about morphological specialization in the cervical vertebrae, which are developmentally constrained in number but highly variable in size and shape. Here, we present the first phylogenetic comparative study of the atlas-axis complex across mammals. We used spherical harmonics to quantify 3D shape variation of the atlas and axis across a diverse sample of species, and performed phylogenetic analyses to investigate if vertebral shape is associated with body size, locomotion, and diet. We found that differences in atlas and axis shape are partly explained by phylogeny, and that mammalian subclades differ in morphological disparity. Atlas and axis shape diversity is associated with differences in body size and locomotion; large terrestrial mammals have craniocaudally elongated vertebrae, while smaller mammals and aquatic mammals have more compressed vertebrae. These results provide a foundation for investigating functional hypotheses underlying the evolution of neck morphologies across mammals. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We introduce the concept of system observability, which can reconstruct states from outputs and their derivatives based on system dynamics. Based on neuromuscular system observability, we estimate the muscle activity from joint torques and kinematics of multiple locomotive gaits, while considering the unknown neural inputs as system disturbances. Moreover, to quantify the robustness of the method, the degree of observability and parameter sensitivity are evaluated. Finally, the neurophysiological implications and generality of the method are addressed."

One of the main challenges pertaining to this field is the prediction of the wearer's desired motion. In this paper, we perform a human locomotion analysis, and we investigate the accuracy of predicting the angular position of the lower limb joints from the motion of walking canes. Nine healthy subjects took part of this study and performed a locomotor task that comprised straight walking on flat ground, stair ascent, and upright resting posture. Recurrent Neural Networks and polynomial fitting using Least Squares were used to model dynamic and static non-linear mappings, respectively, between the motion of a cane and its contra-lateral leg joints. A successful prediction of both the hip and knee joints was achieved using information from the cane only, and significant improvement of the prediction error was realized through the addition of data from the arm joints. Overall, Recurrent Neural Networks outperformed Least Squares for both joints' angular position prediction. When using the cane only, the static maps were able to predict steady behaviour but failed in predicting transitioning, as opposed to RNN, which was able to capture both steady behaviour and transitions."

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the biomechanical and clinical effects of 3 different insoles on rearfoot motion (RFM) and ankle joint moment parameters. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty eight university students with flexible flatfoot were recruited for this study, and each participant was asked to wear 3 different insoles: normal insole without arch support function, type A insole with only arch support function, and type B insole with both arch support and cushion pads for shock absorbing functions. Three-dimensional motion analysis was performed to compute the ranges and peak orientation angles of RFM and ankle joint moment parameters. RESULTS The type A and type B insoles exhibited significantly smaller peak everted position and evertor moment than the normal insole. Also, the type A insole showed significantly smaller range of rearfoot motion in the longitudinal axis and the length of MA (moment arm) in the mediolateral axis than the normal insole. CONCLUSIONS The use of the type A insole using arch support function was induced to promote a cautious gait pattern associated with a relatively lower potential risk compared to the normal insole. The type A and type B insoles could be important to positively reduce the possibility of injury. Also, the smaller length of MA in the type A insole might have a contribution to the decrease of ankle joint evertor moment."

For every ten calories burned, less than one is needed to maintain a constant forward velocity-the remaining energy is, in a sense, wasted. The majority of this wasted energy is expended to support the bodyweight and redirect the center of mass during the stance phase of gait. An order of magnitude less energy is expended to brake and accelerate the swinging leg. Accordingly, most devices designed to increase running efficiency have targeted the costlier stance phase of gait. An alternative approach is seen in nature: spring-like tissues in some animals and humans are believed to assist leg swing. While it has been assumed that such a spring simply offloads the muscles that swing the legs, thus saving energy, this mechanism has not been experimentally investigated. Here we show that a spring, or 'exotendon', connecting the legs of a human reduces the energy required for running by 6.4±2.8%, and does so through a complex mechanism that produces savings beyond those associated with leg swing. The exotendon applies assistive forces to the swinging legs, increasing the energy optimal stride frequency. Runners then adopt this frequency, taking faster and shorter strides, and reduce the joint mechanical work to redirect their center of mass. Our study shows how a simple spring improves running economy through a complex interaction between the changing dynamics of the body and the adaptive strategies of the runner, highlighting the importance of considering each when designing systems that couple human and machine."

However, it is unclear how transposable these results are for birds moving in the wild. Here, using video recordings, we compared the kinematics of locomotion (stride frequency, stride length, stance phase, swing phase, duty factor) and speed range of Svalbard rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta hyperborea) under field and laboratory treadmill conditions. Our findings indicate that the kinematics of walking and aerial running are conserved when moving on the treadmill and in the field. Differences, however, were found when grounded running under the two conditions, linked to substrate. Substrate effects were confirmed by analysing trials only moving over very hard snow. In line with laboratory treadmill energetic predictions, wild ptarmigan have a preferred speed during walking and to a lesser extent when aerial running but not when moving with a grounded running gait. The birds were also capable of a higher top speed in the field than that observed during treadmill studies. Our findings demonstrate that laboratory treadmill research provides meaningful information relevant to wild birds while highlighting the importance of understanding the substrate the animals are moving over."

A total of 10 subjects were recruited. Each subject performed isometric elbow flexion tasks at 20%, 40%, and 60% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) target force levels, and the joint force and high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) signals from biceps brachii and brachialis were collected synchronously. The force estimation model was built using three-order polynomial fitting technique. The input signal extraction of the force model, also named as the preprocessing of HD-sEMG signal, was carried out in the following procedures: first, HD-sEMG signals were decomposed by principal component analysis into principal components and weight vectors; second, the first several weight maps were segmented to obtain heterogeneity information by the Otsu and Moore-Neighbor tracing methods, and the principal component covering the most activated areas was selected; and last, a kurtosis-guided filter was designed to process the selected principal component to obtain the input signal. For the sake of comparison, the joint force estimation experiments based on five preprocessing methods were conducted. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method obtained 52%, 53%, and 59% reduction in the mean root mean square difference at 20% MVC, 40% MVC, and 60% MVC force-level tasks, respectively, compared to the preprocessing method with the first principal component plus fixed parameter filtering. This proposed HD-sEMG pre-processing method has reliable neuromuscular electro-physiological foundation, and has good application value for realizing high-accuracy muscle/joint force estimation in the fields of rehabilitation engineering, sports biomechanics, and muscle disease diagnosis etc."

These challenges include interpreting and co-locating information between different medical imaging modalities that are used to identify tumours and predicting where these tumours move to during different treatment procedures. We have developed a novel automated breast image analysis workflow that integrates state-of-the-art image processing and machine learning techniques, personalized three-dimensional biomechanical modelling and population-based statistical analysis to assist clinicians during breast cancer detection and treatment procedures. This paper summarizes our recent research to address the various technical and implementation challenges associated with creating a fully automated system. The workflow is applied to predict the repositioning of tumours from the prone position, where diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging is performed, to the supine position where treatment procedures are performed. We discuss our recent advances towards addressing challenges in identifying the mechanical properties of the breast and evaluating the accuracy of the biomechanical models. We also describe our progress in implementing a prototype of this workflow in clinical practice. Clinical adoption of these state-of-the-art modelling techniques has significant potential for reducing the number of misdiagnosed breast cancers, while also helping to improve the treatment of patients."

Because more ants collect more resources, this is a multiplicative process, and the expected logarithm of the amount of resources determines how successful the colony will be in the long run. Over 60 years ago, Kelly showed, using information theoretic techniques, that the rate of growth of resources for such a situation is optimized by a strategy of betting in proportion to the probability of pay-off. Thus, in the case of ants, the fraction of the colony foraging at a given location should be proportional to the probability that resources will be found there, a result widely applied in the mathematics of gambling. This theoretical optimum leads to predictions as to which collective ant movement strategies might have evolved. Here, we show how colony-level optimal foraging behaviour can be achieved by mapping movement to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, specifically Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). This can be done by the ants following a (noisy) local measurement of the (logarithm of) resource probability gradient (possibly supplemented with momentum, i.e. a propensity to move in the same direction). This maps the problem of foraging (via the information theory of gambling, stochastic dynamics and techniques employed within Bayesian statistics to efficiently sample from probability distributions) to simple models of ant foraging behaviour. This identification has broad applicability, facilitates the application of information theory approaches to understand movement ecology and unifies insights from existing biomechanical, cognitive, random and optimality movement paradigms. At the cost of requiring ants to obtain (noisy) resource gradient information, we show that this model is both efficient and matches a number of characteristics of real ant exploration."

This new simulation platform allows for the construction of an array of models that objectively represent the key anatomical and functional variation in women with and without prolapse to test pathomechanism hypotheses of the prolapse formation. POP-SIM1.0 consists of anatomically based FE models and a suite of Python-based tools developed to rapidly construct FE models by customizing the base model with desired structural parameters. Each model consists of anatomical structures from three support subsystems which can be customized based on magnetic resonance image measurements in women with and without prolapse. The customizable structural parameters include presence of levator ani (LA) avulsion, hiatus size, anterior vaginal wall dimension, attachment fascia length and apical location in addition to the tissue material properties and intra-abdominal pressure loading. After customization, the FE model was loaded with increasing intra-abdominal pressure (0-100 cmH<sub>2</sub>O) and solved using ABAQUS explicit solver. We were able to rapidly construct anatomically based FE models with specific structural geometry which reflects the morphology changes often observed in women with prolapse. At maximum loading, simulated structural deformations have similar anatomical characteristics to those observed during clinical exams and stress magnetic resonance images. Simulation results showed the presence of LA muscle avulsion negatively impacts the pelvic floor support. The normal model with intact muscle had the smallest exposed vaginal length of 11 mm, while the bilateral avulsion produced the largest exposed vaginal length at 24 mm. The unilateral avulsion model had an exposed vaginal length of 18 mm and also demonstrated a tipped perineal body similar to that seen in clinical observation. Increasing the hiatus size, vaginal wall length and fascia length also resulted in worse pelvic floor support, increasing the exposed vaginal length from 18 mm in the base model to 33 mm, 54 mm and 23.5 mm, respectively. The developed POP-SIM1.0 can simulate the anatomical structure changes often observed in women with prolapse. Preliminary results showed that the presence of LA avulsion, enlarged hiatus, longer vaginal wall and fascia length can result in larger prolapse at simulated maximum Valsalva."

The hypothesis, inferred from prevailing literature, was that these structures would have minimal influence (differences less than ±10%). Two models were made using the Visible Human Project's female cadaver to create a rigid, fixed pelvis, musculature held by spring attachments to that pelvis, and a rigid, ellipsoidal fetal head prescribed with an inferior displacement to simulate delivery. Injury site stretch ratios and fetal head and perineal body displacements and angles of progression were compared between the Omitted Model (which excluded the superficial perineal structures as is common practice) and the Included Model (which included them). Included Model stretch ratios were +107%, -9.84% and -14.6% compared to Omitted Model perineal body and right and left pubovisceral muscles, respectively. Included Model peak perineal body inferior displacement was +72.5% greater while similar anterior-posterior displacements took longer to reach. These results refute our hypothesis, suggesting superficial perineal structures impact simulations of vaginal delivery by inhibiting perineal body anterior-posterior displacement, which stretches and inferiorly displaces the perineal body."

This review paper presents the contributions of the Intelligent Systems for Medicine Laboratory and it's collaborators to this field, discussing the modeling approaches adopted and the methods developed for obtaining the numerical solutions. We adopt a physics-based modeling approach, and describe the brain deformation in mechanical terms (such as displacements, strains and stresses), which can be computed using a biomechanical model, by solving a continuum mechanics problem. We present our modeling approaches related to geometry creation, boundary conditions, loading and material properties. From the point of view of solution methods, we advocate the use of fully nonlinear modeling approaches, capable of capturing very large deformations and nonlinear material behavior. We discuss finite element and meshless domain discretization, the use of the Total Lagrangian formulation of continuum mechanics, and explicit time integration for solving both time-accurate and steady state problems. We present the methods developed for handling contacts and for warping 3D medical images using the results of our simulations. We present two examples to showcase these methods: brain shift estimation for image registration and brain deformation computation for neuronavigation in epilepsy treatment."

However, existing scaling methods for traumatic brain injury (TBI) do not account for the anatomical and morphological complexity of the brains for different species and have not been validated based on accurate anatomy and realistic material properties. In this study, the relationship between the head impact condition and brain tissue deformation was investigated using human, baboon, and macaque brain finite element (FE) models, which featured macroscale and mesoscale anatomical details. The objective was to evaluate existing scaling methods in predicting similar biomechanical responses in the different species using both idealized and real-world head impact pulses. A second objective was to develop a new method to improve how animal data is scaled to humans. As previously found in humans, the animal's brain response to the rotational head motion was well characterized by single-degree-of-freedom (sDOF) mechanical systems with resonance at certain natural frequency, and this concept was leveraged to develop a new TBI scaling method based the natural frequency of the sDOF models representing each species. Previously described biomechanical scaling methods based on mass or inertia ratios were poor predictors of equivalent strain. The novel frequency-based scaling method was an improved approach to scaling the equivalent loading conditions. The findings of this study enable better interpretation of mechanical-trauma responses obtained from animal data to the human, thus effectively advance the development of human injury criteria and contribute towards the mitigation of TBI."

We quantify for the first time the flow near the tentacles of these soft corals, the active pulsations of which are thought to enhance their symbionts' photosynthetic rates by up to an order of magnitude. These polyps are approximately 1 cm in diameter and pulse at frequencies between approximately 0.5 and 1 Hz. As a result, the frequency-based Reynolds number calculated using the tentacle length and pulse frequency is on the order of 10 and rapidly decays as with distance from the polyp. This introduces the question of how these corals minimize the reversibility of the flow and bring in new volumes of fluid during each pulse. We estimate the Péclet number of the bulk flow generated by the coral as being on the order of 100-1000 whereas the flow between the bristles of the tentacles is on the order of 10. This illustrates the importance of advective transport in removing oxygen waste. Flow measurements using particle image velocimetry reveal that the individual polyps generate a jet of water with positive vertical velocities that do not go below 0.1 cm s<sup>-1</sup> and with average volumetric flow rates of approximately 0.71 cm<sup>3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> Our results show that there is nearly continual flow in the radial direction towards the polyp with only approximately 3.3% back flow. 3D numerical simulations uncover a region of slow mixing between the tentacles during expansion. We estimate that the average flow that moves through the bristles of the tentacles is approximately 0.03 cm s<sup>-1</sup> The combination of nearly continual flow towards the polyp, slow mixing between the bristles, and the subsequent ejection of this fluid volume into an upward jet ensures the polyp continually samples new water with sufficient time for exchange to occur."

Neuroinflammation and secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) accompany the main hallmarks of the disease: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In this study, we analyzed the role of IL-6 trans-signaling in two mouse models of AD, Tg2576 and 3xTg-AD mice. The inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling partially rescued the AD-induced mortality in females of both models. Before amyloid plaques deposition, it reversed AD-induced changes in exploration and anxiety (but did not affect locomotion) in Tg2576 female mice. However, after plaque deposition the only behavioral trait affected by the inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling was locomotion. Results in the Morris water maze suggest that cognitive flexibility was reduced by the blocking of the IL-6 trans-signaling in young and old Tg2576 female mice. The inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling also decreased amyloid plaque burden in cortex and hippocampus, and Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub> levels in the cortex, of Tg2576 female mice. The aforementioned changes might be correlated with changes in blood vessels and matrix structure and organization rather than changes in neuroinflammation. 3xTgAD mice showed a very mild phenotype regarding amyloid cascade, but results were in accordance with those of Tg2576 mice. These results strongly suggest that the inhibition of the IL-6 trans-signaling could represent a powerful therapeutic target in AD."

Therefore, in the present study,we examined, in vivo, in the striatum of awake, freely moving rats the effect of cysteamine on the basal andamphetamine-induced release of dopamine, given also the fact that amphetamine-induced psychosis is a widely accepted animal model of schizophrenia.In vivo transversal microdialysis was used to collect the striatal dialysate samples and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), coupled with electrochemical detection, to assess the samples dopamine levels.Amphetamine,1µM, administered locally through the microdialysis fiber, running through both the left and right striatum, produced a significant increase in the extracellular level of dopamine. The increase lasted over an hour whendopamine gradually returned to its basal levels. Cysteamine hydrochloride, perfused locally in the sriatum via the microdialysis probe, at a concentration of 100 µM did not change the basal release of dopamine. However, at the same concentration and administered together with amphetamine, 1µM, it completely inhibited the stimulant effect of amphetamine. To our knowledge, our in vivo results are the first to show direct neurochemical evidence that cysteamine is able to modulate amphetamine-induced dopamine neuronal activity in the striatum of awake, freely moving rats by suppressing the increased by amphetamine release of dopamine."

In particular, the CPGs control the activity of motoneuron (MN) pools which drive the muscles of the individual legs and are thereby responsible for the generation of rhythmic leg movements. The rhythmic activity of the CPGs as well as their connectivity can be modified by the aforementioned sensory signals. However, the precise nature of the interaction between the CPGs and these sensory signals has remained generally largely unknown. Experimental methods aiming at finding out details of these interactions often apply cholinergic agonists such as pilocarpine in order to induce rhythmic activity in the CPGs. Using this general approach, we removed the influence of sensory signals and investigated the putative connections between CPGs controlling the upward/downward movement in the different legs of the stick insect. The experimental data, i.e. the measured MN activities, underwent connectivity analysis using Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM). This method can uncover the underlying coupling structure and strength between pairs of segmental CPGs. For the analysis we set up different coupling schemes (models) for DCM and compared them using Bayesian Model Selection (BMS). Models with contralateral connections in each segment and ipsilateral connections on both sides, as well as the coupling from the meta- to the ipsilateral prothoracic ganglion were preferred by BMS to all other types of models tested. Moreover, the intrasegmental coupling strength in the mesothoracic ganglion was the strongest and most stable in all three ganglia."

Diabetic patients are burdened with higher rates of depression, anxiety and cognitive decline due to inadequate control of blood glucose levels, vascular damage and aberrant CNS insulin signaling. The C57BL/6J model is amongst the most widely used mouse model due to its susceptibility to diet-induced obesity (DIO). This strain has also been well-characterized in behavioral research studies. However the C57BL/6J model has a number of limitations: [1] overt fasting hyperglycemia can only be induced by dietary manipulation and/or chemical ablation of the pancreatic beta cells. [2] There is heterogeneity in the obesogenic response to hypercaloric feeding as well as sex-dependent differences, with males being more responsive. The KK inbred strain has been used to study aspects of the metabolic syndrome and prediabetes due to inherent glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. However KK/HlJ mice are less well-characterized and there have been fewer behavioral studies reported. The aim of this study was to examine differences in male and female glucocentric parameters between KK/HlJ and C57BL/6J mice, and to compare their performance in a variety of standard behavioral tests relating to general, anxiogenic and cognitive paradigms."

One person may retain locomotor and cognitive abilities until the end of life, while another person may lose them during adulthood. Unbiased searches for genes that are required to maintain locomotor ability during adulthood may uncover key regulators of locomotor healthspan. Here, we take advantage of the relatively short lifespan of the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and develop a novel screening procedure to collect mutants with locomotor deficits that become apparent in adulthood. After ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis, we isolated five <i>C. elegans</i> mutant strains that progressively lose adult locomotor ability. In one of the mutant strains, a nonsense mutation in <i>elpc-2</i>, which encodes Elongator Complex Protein Component 2, causes a progressive decline in locomotor ability during adulthood. Mutants and mutations identified in the present screen may provide insights into mechanisms of age-related locomotor impairment and the maintenance of locomotor healthspan."

Since antiepilepsy drugs show limited success in ameliorating cognitive and behavioral symptoms, there is a need to better understand the mechanisms underlying epilepsy-related cognitive and behavioral impairments. Most prior research addressing this problem has focused on chronic epilepsy, wherein many factors can simultaneously impact cognition and behavior. The purpose of the present study was to develop a testing paradigm using mice that can provide new insight into how short-term biological changes underlying acute seizures impact cognition and behavior. In Experiment 1, naïve C57BL/6J mice were subjected to either three brief, generalized electroconvulsive seizure (ECS) or three sham treatments equally spaced over the course of 30 min. Over the next 2 h, mice were tested in a novel object recognition paradigm. Follow-up studies examined locomotor activity immediately before and after (Experiment 2), immediately after (Experiment 3), and 45 min after (Experiment 4) a set of three ECS or sham treatments. Whereas results demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference in recognition memory acquisition between ECS and sham-treated mice, measures of anxiety-like behavior were increased and novel object interest was decreased in ECS-treated mice compared with that in sham. Interestingly, ECS also produced a delayed inhibitory effect on locomotion, decreasing open-field activity 45-min posttreatment compared to sham. We conclude that a small cluster of brief seizures can have acute, behaviorally relevant effects in mice, and that greater emphasis should be placed on events that take place before chronic epilepsy is established in order to better understand epilepsy-related cognitive and behavioral impairments. Future research would benefit from using the paradigms defined above to study the effects of individual seizures on mouse cognition and behavior."

In rodents, sensory input from whiskers plays a crucial role in development of brain functions. Development of whisker system in rats includes the early period of passive whisker touch (PN1-8) before the onset of coordinated whisker movements which underlie active sensing. Inasmuch as transitioning from passive to active sensing requires a strong sensorimotor integration, we assume that the effect of whisker deprivation during the period of passive touch is unfavorable for neurodevelopment, but deprivation after the onset of active sensing might elicit less harmful effect due to compensatory neuroplalstic changes. Here we examined the effect of complete WT in WAG/Rij rats during PN1-8 and PN9-16 (active sensing) on achieving developmental milestones (e.g., eyelid opening, walking, self-grooming, rearing activity, physical maturation of forelimbs), locomotor activity and body weight. Control groups underwent sham trimming during the same periods. WT during PN1-8 caused a delay in achieving all investigated milestones, but trimming during PN9-16 delayed only self-grooming. Both trimming/sham during PN9-16 caused a delay in explorative behavior, but accelerated self-grooming. These changes are likely to link with the effect of manipulations during PN9-16 in previously unhandled pups, but not specifically with WT. In general, developmental milestones appeared to be an informative tool to access neurodevelopment in rat pups and might have a translational value for studying developmental disorders during early life."

Each of the enantiomers in this racemic mixture, (R)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine, have been reported to exert antidepressant effects individually. However, the neuropharmacological effects of these enantiomers and the mechanisms underlying their antidepressive actions have not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the effect of (R,S)-, (R)- and (S)-ketamine on brain activity by functional MRI (fMRI) in conscious rats and compared these with that of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist MK-801 (n = 5~7). We also assessed their pharmacokinetic profiles (n = 4) and their behavioral effects (n = 7~9). This pharmacological MRI study revealed a significant positive response to (S)-ketamine specifically in the cortex, nucleus accumbens and striatum. In contrast, negative fMRI responses were observed in various brain regions after (R)-ketamine administration. (R,S)-ketamine, evoked significant positive fMRI responses specifically in the cortex, nucleus accumbens and striatum, and this fMRI response pattern was comparable with that of (S)-ketamine. MK-801 induced similar fMRI response pattern to (S)-ketamine. The fMRI responses to (S)-ketamine and MK-801 showed differential temporal profiles, which corresponded with brain concentration profiles. (S)-ketamine and MK-801 significantly increased locomotor activity, while (R)-ketamine produced no noticeable change. (R,S)-ketamine tended to increase locomotor activity. Our novel fMRI findings show that (R)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine induce completely different fMRI response patterns on rat, and that the response produced by the latter is similar to that elicited by an NMDAR antagonist. Our findings provide insight into the antidepressant mechanism of (R,S)-ketamine. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The total deletion of <i>Gpr88</i> in mice was shown to decrease anxiety-like behaviors, increase stereotypies and locomotion, and impair motor coordination and motor learning. Knowing the opposing role of D1R- and D2R-MSNs, we here investigated the respective roles of GPR88 in the two MSN subtypes for these behaviors. To do so, we compared effects of a conditional <i>Gpr88</i> gene knock-out (KO) in D1R-MSNs (D1R-<i>Gpr88</i> mice) or D2R-MSNs (A<sub>2A</sub>R-<i>Gpr88</i> mice) with effects of the total <i>Gpr88</i> KO (CMV-<i>Gpr88</i> mice). Overall, most phenotypes of CMV-<i>Gpr88</i> mice were recapitulated in A<sub>2A</sub>R-<i>Gpr88</i> mice, including reduced marble burying, increased social interactions, increased locomotor activity and stereotypies in the open field, and reduced motor coordination in the rotarod. Exceptions were the reduced habituation to the open field and reduced motor skill learning, which were observed in CMV-<i>Gpr88</i> and D1R-<i>Gpr88</i> mice, but not in A<sub>2A</sub>R-<i>Gpr88</i> mice. D1R-<i>Gpr88</i> mice otherwise showed no other phenotype in this study. Our data together show that GPR88 modulates the function of both D1R- and D2R-MSNs, and that GPR88 activity in these two neuron populations has very different and dissociable impacts on behavior. We suggest that GPR88 in D2R-MSNs shapes defensive and social behavior and contributes in maintaining the inhibition of basal ganglia outputs to control locomotion, stereotypies and motor coordination, while GPR88 in D1R-MSNs promotes novelty habituation and motor learning."

These changes, with stress before pregnancy, are potential risk factors for the development of postpartum depression (PPD). A valid animal model of PPD is needed to understand the neurobiological basis of the depressive state of females. To explore a mouse model of PPD, we first assessed anxiety-like and depression-related behaviors in nulliparous (virgin), nonlactating primiparous, and lactating primiparous females in four inbred strains of mice (C57BL/6J, C57BL/6JJcl, BALB/cAnNCrlCrlj, and BALB/cAJcl). Pups from the nonlactating female group were removed one day after parturition to examine the effects of physical interaction with pups on the postpartum behaviors. Second, we investigated the additional effects of prepregnancy stress (restraint stress for 6 h/day for 21 days) on postpartum behaviors in the BALB/cAJcl strain. We found that females of the two BALB/c substrains showed decreased locomotor activity and increased anxiety-like and depression-related behaviors compared with females of the two C57BL/6 substrains. Behavioral differences were also observed between the two substrains of each strain. Additionally, pregnancy- and lactation-dependent behavioral differences were found in some strains: lactating BALB/cAJcl females traveled shorter distance than the females of the other reproductive state groups, while nonlactating and lactating BALB/cAJcl and C57BL/6J females showed increased depression-related behavior compared with nulliparous females. Lactating BALB/cAJcl and C57BL/6JJcl females exhibited decreased sucrose preference or anhedonia-like behavior compared with nulliparous and nonlactating females, although these results did not reach statistical significance after correction for multiple testing. An additional independent experiment replicated the marked behavioral changes in lactating BALB/cAJcl females. Moreover, increased anxiety-like behavior was observed in lactating BALB/cAJcl females that experienced prepregnancy stress. These results suggest genetic contributions to the regulation of anxiety-like and depression-related behaviors in female mice. Furthermore, this study suggests that pregnancy and lactation cause decreased locomotor activity and increased depression-related behaviors, which was consistently found in our results, and that prepregnancy stress enhances anxiety-like behavior in the BALB/cAJcl strain. The inbred strain of female mice may be used as a potential model of PPD to further study the genetic and neurobiological mechanisms underlying the development of this disorder."

A 3D printed upper limb exoskeleton was designed for an individual who had a stroke. Functional and neuromuscular outcomes were measured using his affected hand with and without a 3D printed passive exoskeleton. The goal of this study was to determine the functional and neuromuscular changes induced by the 3D printed exoskeleton in a participant with stroke. <b>Materials and methods:</b> The functional ability of the exoskeleton was assessed using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment and the Box and Block Test. Strength testing and muscle activation of the participant's forearms were measured during maximal voluntary contractions. Furthermore, EMG was measured during the Box and Block Test and satisfaction and usability of the 3D printed exoskeleton were assessed using standardized questionnaires. <b>Results:</b> The exoskeleton improved both the participant's Fugl-Meyer Assessment scores and Box and Block test scores compared to not wearing the device. The subject had increased EMG activation in his extensor when wearing the exoskeleton. <b>Conclusion:</b> The inexpensive 3D printed exoskeleton was effective in assisting the participant with stroke during the functional assessments and has the potential to be used to help regain function of the hand in the home setting of an individual with stroke. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION A 3D printed passive hand exoskeleton may assist to accomplish rehabilitation outcomes by increasing function of the affected hand of patients with stroke. The use of this hand exoskeleton may be used to improve gross hand dexterity and assist with functional grasps during rehabilitation sessions with a lower patient's level of perceived exertion.

While previous theoretical principles focused predominantly on biomechanical accounts, recent models propose that the observed pain modulatory effects of this form of manual therapy may be the result of more complex mechanisms. It has been suggested that other phenomena like neurophysiological responses and the activation of the immune-endocrine system may explain variability in pain inhibition after the administration of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT). The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the available evidence supporting the biological plausibility of high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust (HVLAT) on the immune-endocrine system. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: Narrative critical review. An electronic search on MEDLINE, ProQUEST, and Google Scholar followed by a hand and ""snowballing"" search were conducted to find relevant articles. Studies were included if they evaluated the effects of HVLAT on participants' biomarkers <i>Results</i>: The electronic search retrieved 13 relevant articles and two themes of discussion were developed.

Pain, reduced range of motion or altered posture can have adverse consequences on gait. Although gait has previously been used as a sensitive measure of physical outcomes in elderly and pathological populations, to the best of our knowledge, no study has used gait as a predictor of physical function in patients with axSpA. The objective of our study is hence to determine if gait parameters measured in patients with axSpA could predict the evaluation at 18 months of physical function as assessed by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI). This is a prospective and longitudinal study. Sixty patients with axSpA and 30 healthy age- and sex-matched controls will be included. Patients should be aged 18-65 years at time of their first evaluation, followed at Grenoble Alpes University Hospital for axSpA or ankylosing spondylitis, able to walk 180 m without technical help and with stable treatment for at least 12 months. Clinical characteristics, BASFI, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), clinical and laboratory measurements of gait will be assessed during four visits (at baseline and at months 6, 12, and 18). Similar assessments will be performed once for the healthy control group. A linear mixed model at 6, 12 and 18 months will be constructed to answer to the first objective, with the BASFI as dependent variable and gait parameters as explanatory variables. The data collection started in August 2018 and will be completed with the inclusion and follow-up of all the participants.

In an attempt to limit repetitive head impact exposure during the football preseason, the NCAA eliminated two-a-day practices in 2017, while maintaining the total number of team practice sessions. The objective of this study was to quantify head impact exposure during the preseason and regular season in Division I college football athletes to determine whether the 2017 NCAA ruling decreased head impact exposure. 342 unique athletes from five NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) programs were consented and enrolled. Head impacts were recorded using the Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System during the entire fall preseasons and regular seasons in 2016 and 2017. Despite the elimination of two-a-day practices, the number of preseason contact days increased in 2017, with an increase in average hourly impact exposure (i.e., contact intensity), resulting in a significant increase in total head impact burden (+ 26%) for the 2017 preseason. This finding would indicate that the 2017 NCAA ruling was not effective at reducing the head impact burden during the football preseason. Additionally, athletes sustained a significantly higher number of recorded head impacts per week (+ 40%) during the preseason than the regular season, implicating the preseason as a time of elevated repetitive head impact burden. With increased recognition of a possible association between repetitive head impact exposure and concussion, increased preseason exposure may predispose certain athletes to a higher risk of concussion during the preseason and regular season. Accordingly, efforts at reducing concussion incidence in contact sports should include a reduction in overall head impact exposure."

By consequence, it behooves those teaching physical education to put in place mechanisms that promote as well as motivate children to master their FMS. One approach to achieving this goal is through the adoption of mastery motivational climates (MMC) in physical education. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a year-long (9-month) MMC physical education program on preschool children's FMS learning. <b>Method</b>: Participants (<i>N</i> = 96, MMC = 58, Comparison = 38) completed the Test of Gross Motor Development-Third Edition prior to and after intervention. Intact classrooms were randomly assigned to either a MMC or comparison group. A repeated measures nested MANOVA was used to test changes by group. Follow-up measurements included univariate repeated measures and simple effects analyses. <b>Results</b>: There were no significant multivariate differences based on class membership (<i>p</i> = .249), indicating the nested structure was not associated with any meaningful differences in test scores. There was a significant multivariate difference based on the interaction of time (pre- versus post-test) and group (<i>p</i> < .001). Both locomotor and ball skills significantly varied between groups and across time. Children in both groups improved from pre-test to post-test, but the rate of improvement was significantly greater for the MMC group. <b>Conclusions</b>: A year-long MMC intervention is beneficial for improving children's FMS."

Given the popularity of trail running, we designed an intervention study to investigate whether a strategy with regular changes in foot strike pattern during downhill running could reduce the extent of fatigue on neuromuscular, energetics and biomechanical parameters as well as increase an uphill time-to-exhaustion trial (TTE) performance. Fourteen experienced trail runners completed two interventional conditions (separated by 15 days) in a pseudo-randomised and counter-balanced order that consisted of 2.5-h of treadmill graded running with (switch condition) or without (control condition) a change between fore- and rear-foot strike pattern every 30 s during the downhill sections. Pre and Post, neuromuscular tests were performed to assess PF central and peripheral fatigue. Energy cost of running was assessed using an indirect calorimetry system and biomechanical gait parameters were acquired with an instrumented treadmill. TTE was performed after both the graded running conditions. There were not significant condition × time interactions (<i>p </i>≥ .085) for any of the variables considered, and TTE was not different between the two conditions (<i>p </i>= .755). A deliberate strategy to alternate between foot strike patterns did not reduce the extent of fatigue during prolonged graded running. We suggest that it is not the ability to switch between foot strike patterns that minimises fatigue; rather the ability to adapt foot strike pattern to the terrain and therefore a better running technique."

We analyzed running and swimming performance, strength manifestation, body composition, and autonomic modulation before and after a traditional linear training periodization (four weeks of volume-based training plus four weeks of intensity-based training plus two-week tapering), a reverse linear training periodization (four weeks of intensity-based training plus four weeks of volume-based training plus two-week tapering), and a free training control physical active group (10-week free training) in 32 amateur athletes. Independently of the periodization model, the combination of two four-week mesocycles followed by a two-week taper is an efficiency strategy to avoid overreaching, obtaining an increase in parasympathetic modulation. Moreover, both types of training periodization proposed in this study do not modified body composition of amateur triathletes. Also, compared with traditional periodization, reverse periodization efficiently improves horizontal jump performance. Finally, reverse and traditional periodization were an effective strategy to improve running biomechanical, performance, and physiological variables, as well as efficient periodization strategies to improve swimming technical ability, aerobic, and anaerobic swimming performance."

The metal pole hit a man standing close beside it; the man had a head injury severity that is more commonly due to falling objects than due to traffic accidents. Assuming a head mass of 5 kg, simplified calculations yield maximum contact forces of ca. 36 kN exceeding mean parietal fracture forces which are in the order of magnitude of 12.5 kN. The influences of the effective body mass and the horizontal distance between the pole and the pedestrian on maximum contact forces are investigated. High contact forces in our case can be mainly explained by the comparably high impact velocity and by a partial mass transfer of the total car mass to the pole."

However, the mechanical strength of tendons is compromised after surgery, thus causing a high rate of tendon retear. Hence, the design and preparation of biodegradable materials with excellent mechanical properties have become an urgent demand for sports medicine. In this study, biomimetic polycaprolactone (PCL)/gelatin (Gel)-aligned scaffolds were fabricated for the mechanical restoration of the injured tendon in a rabbit model. The diameter of nanofibers was about 427.82 ± 56.99 nm, which was approximate to that of the native collagen fibrils; the directional consistency of the nanofibers in PCL/Gel-aligned scaffolds reached 77.33 ± 3.22%, which were ultrastructurally biomimetic. Compared to the observations for the control group, the in vitro mechanical results showed that the PCL/Gel-aligned scaffolds (P/G-A) were anisotropic in terms of failure load, tensile strength, and Young's modulus. After verifying their good cytocompatibility, the scaffolds were implanted into the rabbit patellar tendon in situ. The biomechanical properties of the repaired tendon in P/G-A reached 343.97 ± 65.30 N in failure load, 85.99 ± 16.33 MPa in tensile strength, 590.84 ± 201.87 MPa in Young's modulus, and 171.29 ± 61.50 N mm-1 in stiffness in vivo at 8 weeks post operation. In a word, our results demonstrated that P/G-A could support the regenerated tissue of injured patellar tendons to restore the biomechanical strength in a rabbit model. This suggested that the PCL/Gel-aligned scaffolds can pave a promising way to improve the healing of injured tendons in the clinic in the future."

The aim of this preliminary study was to quantify the relative motion of the ulna with respect to the humerus in two human upper limbs specimens and to investigate the constraints role for maintaining the elbow joint stability in different section conditions. Two clusters of four markers were fixed respectively to the ulna and humerus, and their trajectory was recorded by a motion capture system during functional orthopedic maneuver. Considering the posterior bundle of medial collateral complex (pMUCL) and the coronoid, two section sequences were executed. The orthopedic maneuver of compression, pronation and varus force was repeated at 30°, 60° and 90° flexion for the functional investigation of constraints. Ulna deflection was compared to a baseline elbow flexion condition. With respect to the intact elbow, the coronoid osteotomy influences the elbow stability at 90° (deflection = 11.49 ± 17.39 mm), while small differences occur at 30° and 60°, due to ligaments constraint. The contemporary pMUCL section and coronoid osteotomy causes elbow instability, with large deflection at 30° (deflection = 34.40 ± 9.10 mm), 60° (deflection = 45.41 ± 18.47 mm) and 90° (deflection = 52.16 ± 21.92 mm). Surgeons may consider the pMUCL reconstruction in case of unfixable coronoid fracture."

We investigated compliance by performing a unique radial expansion testing method using urethras from six- to nine-month-old pigs.

Although there was no significant difference in Young's modulus data, there were differences between groups as can be seen in the raw radial expansion testing data. Results showed that BPGs have the potential to increase hydration in samples, and that there was a significant difference in water uptake between BPG-injected samples and the controls (100 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> samples versus PBS samples, <i>p</i> < 0.05). This work shows that BPGs have the potential to be implemented as a molecular treatment for SUI, by restoring the diminished proteoglycan content and subsequently increasing hydration and improving the compliance of urethral tissue."

Most studies lack a multifactorial analysis of what causes breast implants to rupture. To fill this gap, an experimental protocol was developed to compare ruptured and intact Poly Implant Prothèse (PIP) breast implants from the same woman. These conditions guarantee that the physical/biological variables are the same for each pair of ruptured and intact implants. A total of 1008 samples from 22 PIP explants (11 intact and 11 ruptured) and three control PIP implants were analysed. The mechanical properties (tensile strength) of the ruptured and intact implants were compared according to brand, lot, implantation time and demographic conditions. In general, statistically significant differences were found between the intact and ruptured PIP implants. Ruptured implants were thinner (0.73 ± 0.10 mm versus 0.91 ± 0.11 mm) and weaker (7.42 ± 2.65 MPa versus 9.59 ± 2.37 MPa) than intact implants. Intact and ruptured implants have shown distinct mechanical behaviours and variations in thickness. Our understanding is that these differences may be associated with the typical manufacturing process of breast implant shells. These results stress the importance of thorough control of the shell thickness. Given its relevance, shell thickness should be used as a quality control measure for homologation purposes. Thus, the homogeneity of the shell should be considered as a relevant parameter during the manufacturing process. This will translate into an improved quality of life for patients and will potentiate safer and longer lasting products."

In contrast to the earlier conventional design concepts, e.g., raster-angle, a workflow was established to produce scaffolds with triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) architecture. A core challenge is the realization of such structures using melt-extrusion based 3D printing. This study presents methods for generation of scaffold design files, finite element analysis of scaffold Young's moduli, AM of scaffolds with polycaprolactone (PCL), and a customized in vitro assay to evaluate cell migration. The reliability of FE analysis when using computer-aided designed models as input may be impeded by anomalies introduced into the scaffolds during 3D printing. Further investigation using micro-computed tomography reconstructions of printed scaffolds as an input for numerical simulation in comparison to experimentally obtained scaffold Young's moduli showed a moderate trend (R2 = 0.62). Interestingly, in a preliminary cell migration assay, adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AdMSC) migrated furthest on PCL scaffolds with Diamond, followed by Gyroid and Schwarz P architectures. A similar trend, but with an accelerated AdMSC migration rate, was observed for PCL scaffolds surface coated with calcium-phosphate-based apatite. We elaborate on the importance of start-to-finish integration of all steps of AM, i.e. design, engineering and manufacturing. Using such a workflow, specific biological and mechanical functionality, e.g., improved regeneration via enhanced cell migration and higher structural integrity, may be realized for scaffolds intended as temporary guiding structures for endogenous tissue regeneration."

Accordingly, various techniques have been developed to estimate tissue mechanical properties. Shear-wave elastography (SWE) measures shear-wave speed (SWS) in tissues, which can be related to shear modulus. Although viscosity or stress-strain non-linearity may act as confounder of SWE, their explicit characterization may also provide additional information about tissue composition as a contrast modality. Viscosity can be related to frequency dispersion of SWS, which can be characterized using multi-frequency measurements, herein called spectral shear-wave elastography (SSWE). Additionally, non-linear shear modulus can be quantified and parameterized based on SWS changes with respect to applied stress; a phenomenon called acousto-elasticity (AE). In this work, we characterize the non-linear parameters of tissue as a function of excitation frequency by utilizing both AE and SSWE together. For this, we apply incremental amounts of quasi-static stress on a medium, while imaging and quantifying SWS dispersion via SSWE. Results from phantom and ex-vivo porcine liver experiments demonstrate the feasibility of measuring frequency-dependent non-linear parameters using the proposed method. SWS propagation in porcine liver tissue was observed to change from 1.8 m/s at 100 Hz to 3.3 m/s at 700 Hz, while increasing by approximately 25% from a strain of 0% to 12% across these frequencies.

These research are mainly done on the porcine small intestine. However, a report has recently been published about a scaffold produced from the submucosal layer of the ovine small intestine. In the present study, ovine small intestine submucosal (OSIS) was decellularized in a modified manner and its histological, morphological, and biomechanical properties were studied. Decellularization was performed in two phases: physical and chemical. In this method, a chloroform-methanol mixture, enzymatic digestion, and a constant dose of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was used in the least agitation time and its histological property and biocompatibility were evaluated in the presence of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs); furthermore, ADSCs were isolated with a simple method (modified physical washing non-enzymatic isolation). The results were showed that the use of OSIS could be effective and operative. Mechanical properties, histological structure and shape, and glycosaminoglycan content were preserved. In the SDS-treated group, more than 90% of the native cells of tissue were deleted, and also in this group, no toxicity was observed and cell proliferation was supported, compared to the untreated group. Therefore, our results indicate that ADSCs seeded on OSIS scaffold could be used as a new approach in regenerative medicine as hybrid or hydrogel application."

However, the processing difficulty and poor osteoinductive ability greatly limit the application of HA. Although many strategies have been reported to improve the machinability and osteointegration ability, the performance including mechanical strength, porosity, cell adhesion, <i>etc.</i> of material still can not meet the requirements. In this work, a soft template method was developed and a porous scaffold with hierarchical pore structure, nano surface morphology, suitable porosity and pore size, and good biomechanical strength was successfully prepared. The hierarchical pore structure is beneficial for cell adhesion, fluid transfer, and cell ingrowth. Moreover, the loaded reduced graphene oxide (rGO) can improve the adhesion and promote the proliferation and spontaneous osteogenic differentiation bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. The scaffold is then crushed, degraded and wrapped by the newly formed bone and the newly formed bone gradually replaces the scaffold. The degradation rate of the scaffold well matches the rate of the new bone formation. The hierarchical porous HA/rGO composite scaffolds can greatly accelerate the bone ingrowth in the scaffold and bone repair in critical bone defects, thus providing a clinical potential candidate for large segment bone tissue engineering."

Rabbits allowed to have a visual and olfactory contact showed a significantly higher expression of important natural behaviors (olfactory investigation, gnawing, alertness, stretching, locomotion) compared to the isolated rabbits (with or without mirrors); while rabbits in the mirror group showed higher allo-grooming activity than those isolated and no different locomotion activity than those separated by wire mesh. Thus, mirrors seemed to be able to modify the behavioral repertoire of isolated rabbits by acting on social perception in rabbits reared in small groups in a free-range system. Nevertheless, despite it being advisable to use a combination of different indicators in order to assess the stress level of an animal, the accuracy of serum cortisol, as well as of some secondary stress markers assay, appeared to be limited in this type of breeding."

It is unclear how these tools have penetrated the equine industry or what perspectives industry stakeholders' hold in relation to these relatively new devices. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with Irish equine industry stakeholders to understand their perception of objective tools for biomechanical analysis in the field. The study participants came from professional/elite backgrounds in both the sport horse (<i>n</i> = 6) and thoroughbred (<i>n</i> = 6) sectors. The interview data were analysed using thematic analysis, resulting in four analytical themes. The first theme conveys the importance of tacit knowledge and experience in the holistic analysis of a horse. Theme two highlights that the perfect horse does not exist therefore, equine athlete management is complex and requires a multi-layered problem-solving approach. Theme three describes an awareness among stakeholders of technologies, however they are sceptical of their value. The final theme identified that one of the key barriers to technology adoption is the economic value of the horse and the cost of implementing technology herd-wide. Our findings highlight the need for a user-centred design in this domain, which requires greater consultation and learning between technology developers and equine stakeholders to develop fit-for-purpose analysis and monitoring tools."

Many techniques have been used to repair these fractures, with common techniques including veterinary acetabular plates or use of screw/wire/polymethylmethacrylate constructs. String-of-Pearl™ plating systems have also been used clinically but there is a lack of research supporting their use for these fractures. The purpose of this study was to compare fracture reduction accuracy, biomechanical characteristics, and mode of failure between String-of-Pearls™, veterinary acetabular plates, screw/wire/polymethylmethacrylate constructs in a simulated, ex-vivo acetabular fracture model. We hypothesized that the String-of-Pearls™ constructs would have equivalent or greater mechanical properties and reduction compared to the other constructs."

Adjustments in dietary ingredients might affect bone development and consequently locomotion related problems. This study was designed to evaluate effects of dietary organic minerals (ORM), fish oil (FISH), and hydrolyzed collagen (COL) on growth performance and tibia characteristics of broiler chickens. A total of three hundred eighty four 1-day-old Ross 308 male broiler chickens were used in a complete randomized block design with 4 diet groups and 8 replicates per diet group. In the ORM diet, the inorganic macro and trace minerals were replaced by their organic varieties. In the FISH diet, palm oil and soybean oil were partly replaced by FISH. In the COL diet, soybean meal was partly replaced by COL. Results showed that the ORM and COL diet groups reached a higher body weight (BW) at 42 D of age than the FISH diet group, whereas the control group was in between. The feed conversion ratio between day 1 and 42 was lower in the ORM and COL diet groups than in both other diet groups. On day 28, 35, and 42, gait score (GS), Varus Valgus deformity, tibia length (TL), thickness, femoral and metatarsal head thickness (THT), mineral content (TMC), mineral density (TMD), breaking strength (TBS), stiffness (TSF), and energy to fracture (TEF) were measured (n = 3/replicate). The ORM diet group had higher TL at day 42, higher THT at day 28, higher TMC at day 42, higher TMD at day 28, 35, and 42, higher TBS at day 42, higher TSF at day 35 and 42, and higher TEF at day 42 compared to the FISH diet group, with the COL and control diet groups in between. It can be concluded that replacing dietary inorganic macro and trace minerals by their organic varieties seems to stimulate tibia dimensions, strength, and mineral content of broiler chickens. On the contrary, FISH appears to negatively affect tibia characteristics."
