preclinical testing nalfurafine opioid sparing adjuvant potentiates analgesia mu opioid receptor targeting agonist morphine,BONE,75.6% BONE; 6.3% MODELING; 5.2% COMPARATIVE,"Kaski SW, White AN, Gross JD, Trexler KR, Wix K, Harland AA, Prisinzano TE, Aube J, Kinsey SG, Kenakin T, Siderovski D, Setola V,",*The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics*,* [Preclinical testing of nalfurafine as an opioid-sparing adjuvant that potentiates analgesia by the mu opioid receptor-targeting agonist morphine.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31492823),Preclinical testing of nalfurafine as an opioid-sparing adjuvant that potentiates analgesia by the mu opioid receptor-targeting agonist morphine.,"Mu opioid receptor (MOR)-targeting analgesics are efficacious pain treatments, but notorious for their abuse potential. In preclinical animal models, co administration of traditional kappa opioid receptor (KOR)-targeting agonists with MOR-targeting analgesics can decrease reward and potentiate analgesia. However, traditional KOR-targeting agonists are well known for inducing anti-therapeutic side effects (psychotomimesis, depression, anxiety, dysphoria). Recent data suggest that some functionally selective, or biased, KOR-targeting agonists might retain the therapeutic effects of KOR activation without inducing undesirable side effects. Nalfurafine, used safely in Japan since 2009 for uremic pruritus, is one such functionally selective KOR-targeting agonist. Here, we quantify the bias of nalfurafine and several other KOR agonists relative to an unbiased reference standard (U50,488), and show that nalfurafine and EOM-salvinorin-B demonstrate marked G protein-signaling bias. While nalfurafine (0.015 mg/kg) and EOM-salvinorin-B (1 mg/kg) produced spinal anti-nociception equivalent to 5 mg/kg U50,488, only nalfurafine significantly enhanced the supraspinal analgesic effect of 5 mg/kg morphine. In addition, 0.015 mg/kg nalfurafine did not produce significant conditioned place aversion (CPA), yet retained the ability to reduce morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in C57BL/6J mice. Nalfurafine and EOM-salvinorin-B each produced robust inhibition of both spontaneous and morphine-stimulated locomotor behavior, suggesting a persistence of sedative effects when co-administered with morphine. Taken together, these findings suggest that nalfurafine produces analgesic augmentation, while also reducing opioid-induced reward with less risk of dysphoria. Thus, adjuvant administration of G protein-biased KOR agonists like nalfurafine may be beneficial in enhancing the therapeutic potential of MOR-targeting analgesics, such as morphine.

rat bone properties relationship gait growth,BONE,91.8% MODELING; 4.1% JOINT/CARTILAGE; 1.1% METHODS,"Song H, Polk JD, Kersh ME,",*The Journal of experimental biology*,* [Rat bone properties and their relationship to gait during growth.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31492819),Rat bone properties and their relationship to gait during growth.,"Allometric relationships have been queried over orders of mammals to understand how bone accommodates the mechanical demands associated with increasing mass. However, less attention has been given to the scaling of bone within a single lifetime. We aimed to determine how bone morphology and tissue density are related to (1) bending and compressive strength, and (2) gait dynamics. Longitudinal in vivo computed tomography of the hindlimbs and gait data were collected from female rats (n=5, age 8 - 20 weeks). Cross sectional properties and tissue density were measured at the diaphysis, distal, and proximal regions of the tibia and scaling exponents were calculated. Finite element models of the tibia were used to simulate loading during walking using joint forces from inverse dynamics calculation to determine the strain energy density (SED) and longitudinal strain at the midshaft. Second moment of area at the diaphysis followed strain similarity based allometry, while bone area trended towards positive allometry. Strain energy in the diaphysis under transverse loading was lower than axial loading throughout growth. While both axial and transverse loading resulted in bending, tensile strains were mitigated by a change in the neutral axis and resulted in overall lower longitudinal tensile strains. The tissue density and cross-sectional properties initially increased and converged by 11 weeks of age and were correlated with changes in ground reaction forces. The scaling analyses imply that rodent tibia is (re)modeled in order to sustain bending at the midshaft during growth. The finite element results and relatively constant density after 10 weeks of age indicate that structural parameters may be the primary determinant of bone strength in the growing rodent tibia. The correlations between bone properties and joint angles imply that the changes in posture may affect bone growth in specific regions.

Rats were randomly divided into Sham (Sham-operated), Sham+V, OVX (ovariectomized), OVX+E2 (estradiol benzoate), OVX+V (LMV at 12-20 weeks postoperatively), and OVX+Vi (LMV at 1-20 weeks postoperatively) groups. LMV was applied for 20 min once daily for 5 days weekly. V rats were loaded with LMV at 12-20 weeks postoperatively. Vi rats were loaded with LMV at 1-20 weeks postoperatively. Estradiol (E2) rats were intramuscularly injected at 12-20 weeks postoperatively once daily for 3 days. The bone mineral densities (BMDs), biomechanical properties, and histomorphological parameters of tibiae were analyzed. <i>In vitro</i>, rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) were subjected to LMV for 30 min daily for 5 days, or 17β-E2 with or without 1-day pretreatment of estrogen receptor (ER) inhibitor ICI 182,780 (ICI). The mRNA and protein expresion were performed. Data showed that LMV increased BMD, bone strength, and bone mass of rats, and the effects of Vi were stronger than those of E2. <i>In vitro</i>, LMV up-regulated the mRNA and protein expressions of Runx2, Osx, Col I, and OCN and down-regulated PPARγ, compared with E2. The effects of both LMV and E2 on rBMSCs were inhibited by ICI. Altogether, LMV in early PMO suppresses its progression, which is associated with osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs via up-regulation of ERα and activation of the canonical Wnt pathway. LMV may therefore be superior to E2 for the suppression of PMO progression."

In Australopithecus africanus and Paranthropus robustus, the cancellous bone organization at the center of the femoral head shows principal strut orientation similar to that of fossil and recent humans, which indicates that australopiths were human-like in many aspects of their bipedalism. However, by combining outer morphology with superoinferior asymmetry in cortical bone thickness at the base of neck and mid-neck, it has been suggested that, while adapted for terrestrial bipedality, australopiths displayed a slightly altered gait kinematics compared to Homo. We used techniques of 2D and 3D virtual imaging applied to an X-ray microtomographic record to assess cortical bone distribution along the entire femoral neck compartment in four upper femora from Swartkrans, South Africa (SK 82, SK 97, SK 3121, and SWT1/LB-2) and compared the results to the extant human and chimpanzee conditions. Our results support and extend previous evidence for more symmetric superior and inferior femoral neck cortical thicknesses in P. robustus than in modern humans and show that the differences are even greater than previously reported. However, P. robustus and humans still share a trend of lateral-to-medial decrease in asymmetry of the superior/inferior cortical thickness ratio, while this pattern is reversed in chimpanzees. We also identified two features uniquely characterizing P. robustus: an accentuated contrast between the relatively thicker anterior and the thinner posterior walls, and a more marked lateral-to-medial thinning of both cortices compared to extant humans and chimpanzees, which indicate wider interspecific differences among hominids in structural organization of the proximal femur than previously reported. It remains to be ascertained if, and to what extent, these features also characterize the femoral neck of Australopithecus."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical performance of fractured clavicles repaired using a novel intramedullary Echidna pin device and a non-threaded Knowles pin. The Echidna pin features retractable spines that engage with the bone to minimize migration and facilitate ease of device removal."

However, neuromuscular properties (e.g. peak force) also account for unique portions of variance in skeletal outcomes. We utilized serial multiple mediation to explore the intermediary role of muscle mass and force in the relationships between cortical bone and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA). In a cross-sectional sample of young adults (n = 147, 19.7 ± 0.7 yo, 52.4% female) cortical diaphyseal bone was assessed via peripheral quantitative computed tomography at the mid-tibia. Peak isokinetic torque in knee extension was assessed via Biodex dynamometer. Thigh fat-free soft tissue (FFST) mass, assessed via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometer, represented the muscular aspect of tibial mechanical forces. Habitual MVPA was assessed objectively over 7 days using Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers. Participants exceeded MVPA guidelines (89.14 ± 27.29 minutes/day), with males performing 44.5% more vigorous-intensity activity relative to females (p < .05). Males had greater knee extension torque and thigh FFST mass compared to females (55.3%, and 34.2%, respectively, all p < .05). In combined-sex models, controlling for tibia length and age, MVPA was associated with strength strain index (pSSI) through two indirect pathways: 1) thigh FFST mass (Coeff. = 1.11 ± .37, CI: .47-1.93), and 2) thigh FFST mass and knee extensor torque in sequence (Coeff. = .30 ± .16, CI: .09-.73). However, in sex-specific models MVPA was associated with pSSI indirectly through its relationship with knee extensor torque in males (Coeff. = .78 ± .48, CI: .04-2.02) and thigh FFST mass in females (Coeff. = 1.12 ± .50, CI: .37-2.46). Bootstrapped confidence intervals confirmed these mediation pathways. The relationship between MVPA and cortical structure appears to be mediated by muscle in young adults, with potential sex-differences in the muscular pathway. If confirmed, these findings may highlight novel avenues for the promotion of bone strength in young adults. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Consequences on arterial structure-function and therapeutical perspectives.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31493460),Rise and fall of elastic fibers from development to aging. Consequences on arterial structure-function and therapeutical perspectives.,"In the arteries of vertebrates, evolution has given rise to resilient macromolecular structures, elastin and elastic fibers, capable of sustaining an elevated blood pressure and smoothing the discontinuous blood flow and pressure generated by the heart. Elastic fibers are produced only during development and childhood, before being progressively degraded by mechanical stress and enzymatic activities during adulthood and aging. During this period, arterial elastic fiber calcification and loading of lipids also occur, all of these events conducting to arteriosclerosis. This leads to a progressive dysfunction of the large elastic arteries inducing elevated blood pressure as well as altered hemodynamics and organ perfusion, which induce more global malfunctions of the body during normal aging. Additionally, some arterial conditions occur more frequently with advancing age, such as atherosclerosis or aneurysms, which are called age-related diseases or pathological aging. The physiological or pathological degradation of elastic fibers and function of elastic arteries seemed to be rather inevitable over time. However, during the recent years, different molecules - including several ATP-dependent potassium channel openers - have been shown to re-induce elastin production and elastic fiber assembly, leading to improvements in the arterial structure and function or in organ perfusion. This review summarizes the changes in the arterial elastic fibers and structure from development until aging, and presents some of the potential pharmacotherapies leading to elastic fiber neosynthesis and arterial function improvement."

Herein, we address the molecular mechanisms affecting endothelium remodeling in disease. Vascular calcification is highly prevalent in patients with ischemic cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disorder, and renal failure, being a common feature in aging, diabetes, dyslipidemia, abnormal valve biomechanics, end-stage renal disease and atherosclerosis, a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Oxidative stress promotes calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) by increasing osteogenic transcription factors expression and activity in atherosclerotic plaques. Various markers of osteogenic differentiation are expressed by SMC in calcified atherosclerotic lesions. Interestingly, decreased levels of some bone factors and microRNAs accelerate vascular calcification and injured tissue regeneration. Another key player in endothelial remodeling is amino acids metabolism. Branched-chain amino acids are catabolized in several nonhepatic tissues including cardiac muscle. Immune activation and inflammation in cardiovascular disease patients associate with higher phenylalanine/tyrosine ratios. Understanding the whole process that underlies endothelium dysfunction is of paramount importance for the development of new therapeutic approaches."
gene loaded nanoparticle coated sutures provide effective gene delivery enhance tendon healing,CELLULAR/SUBCELLULAR,53.1% MODELING; 35.2% METHODS; 1.9% TISSUE/BIOMATERIAL,"Zhou YL, Yang QQ, Yan YY, Zhang L, Wang QH, Ju F, Tang JB,",*Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy*,* [Gene-Loaded Nanoparticle-Coated Sutures Provide Effective Gene Delivery to Enhance Tendon Healing.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31278034),Gene-Loaded Nanoparticle-Coated Sutures Provide Effective Gene Delivery to Enhance Tendon Healing.,"How to accelerate tendon healing remains a clinical challenge. In this study, a suture carrying nanoparticle/pEGFP-basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and pEGFP-vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) complexes was developed to transfer the growth factor genes into injured tendon tissues to promote healing. Polydopamine-modified sutures can uniformly and tightly absorb nanoparticle/plasmid complexes. After tendon tissues were sutured, the nanoparticle/plasmid complexes still existed on the suture surface. Further, we found that the nanoparticle/plasmid complexes delivered into tendon tissues could diffuse from sutures to tendon tissues and effectively transfect genes into tendon cells, significantly increasing the expression of growth factors in tendon tissues. Finally, biomechanical tests showed that nanoparticle/pEGFP-bFGF and pEGFP-VEGFA complex-coated sutures could significantly increase the ultimate strengths of repaired tendons, especially at 4 weeks after operation. Two kinds of nanoparticle/plasmid complex-coated sutures significantly increased flexor tendon healing strength by 3.7 times for Ethilon and 5.8 times for PDS II, respectively, compared with the corresponding unmodified sutures. In the flexor tendon injury model, at 6 weeks after surgery, compared with the control suture, the nanoparticle/plasmid complex-coated sutures can significantly increase the gliding excursions of the tendon and inhibit the formation of adhesion. These results indicate that this nanoparticle/plasmid complex-coated suture is a promising tool for the treatment of injured tendons."

It has also been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia. Here, we utilized male and female constitutive and conditional Arc/Arg3.1 knock out (KO) mice to investigate the causal relationship between Arc/Arg3.1 deletion and schizophrenia-linked neurophysiological and behavioral phenotypes. Using <i>in vivo</i> local field potential (LFP) recordings, we observed dampened oscillatory activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the KO and early conditional KO (Early-cKO) mice, in which Arc/Arg3.1 was deleted perinatally. Whole cell patch clamp recordings from neurons in PFC slices revealed altered synaptic properties and reduced network gain in the KO mice as possible mechanisms underlying the oscillation deficits. In contrast, we measured normal oscillatory activity in the PFC of late conditional KO (Late-cKO) mice, in which Arc/Arg3.1 was deleted during late postnatal development. Our data show that constitutive Arc/Arg3.1 KO mice exhibit no deficit in social engagement, working memory, sensorimotor gating, native locomotor activity, and dopaminergic innervation. Moreover, adolescent social isolation, an enviromental stressor, failed to induce deficits in socialbility or sensorimotor gating in adult KO mice. Thus, genetic removal of Arc/Arg3.1 <i>per se</i> does not cause schizophrenia-like behavior. Pre- or perinatal deletion of Arc/Arg3.1 alters cortical network activity, however, without overtly disrupting the balance of excitation and inhibition in the brain and not promoting schizophrenia. Misregulation of Arc/Arg3.1 rather than deletion could potentially tip this balance and thereby promote emergence of schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders.<b>Significance Statement</b>The activity-regulated and memory-linked gene Arc/Arg3.1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, but direct evidence and a mechanistic link are still missing. The current study asks whether loss of Arc/Arg3.1 can affect brain circuitry and cause schizophrenia-like symptoms in mice. The findings demonstrate that genetic deletion of Arc/Arg3.1 before puberty alters synaptic function and prefrontal cortex activity. Although brain networks are disturbed, genetic deletion of Arc/Arg3.1 does not cause schizophrenia, even when combined with an environmental assault. It remains to be seen whether misregulation of Arc/Arg3.1 might critically imbalance brain networks and lead to emergence of schizophrenia."

Females are predominately affected by MS compared to males and develop motor symptoms earlier. However, key symptoms affect all patients regardless of sex. Previous studies have shown that demyelination and axonal damage play key roles in symptom development, but it is unclear why sex differences exist in MS onset, and effective symptom treatment is still lacking. We here used a non-pertussis toxin (nPTX) experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in C57BL/6 mice, to explore chronic symptoms and sex differences in CNS autoimmunity. We observed that, like in humans, female mice developed motor disease earlier than males. Further, changes in pre- and post-synaptic protein expression levels were observed in a sexually dimorphic manner with an overall shift towards excitatory signaling. Our data suggest that this shift towards excitatory signaling is achieved through different mechanisms in males and females. Altogether, our study helps to better understand sex-specific disease mechanisms to ultimately develop better diagnostic and treatment tools."

Potential detriments had also been multidimensionally investigated. However, there had been no study exploring whether treatment with antidepressants causes psychological and/or behavioral alterations in offspring. In this regard, we chronically treated normal female mice with different dosages (0, 10, and 20 mg/kg) of fluoxetine (FLU) for 2 weeks before mating them with drug-free male mice and then tested the offspring for anxiety/depression-like behaviors with the elevated plus maze and the tail-suspension test after exposing to acute or chronic stress in adult period. We found that there were significant increases for immobility time in the tail-suspension test as well as percentage of open arm entries and percentage of open arm time in the elevated plus maze test detected in the female offspring of the 20 mg group compared to both baseline and all other groups, with the exception that the female offspring of the 10 mg group showed an increased percentage of open arm entries after chronic stress exposure. Locomotor activity assessments showed that neither acute nor chronic stress protocol could significantly affect locomotor activities of mice. Conclusionally, we found that high-dosage FLU increased the risk of the female offspring developing into depression/anxiety-like behaviors after stress exposure, with chronic stress as the environmental-risk factor. Our study has important implications for the safe use of antidepressant agents and raises more concerns regarding long-term use of even second-generation antidepressants in clinical practice."

Importantly, while missense mutations of PRPS1 have been identified in neurological disorders such as Arts syndrome, how they contribute to neuropathogenesis is still unclear. We identified the Drosophila ortholog of PRPS (dPRPS) as a direct target of RB/E2F in Drosophila, a vital cell cycle regulator, and engineered dPRPS alleles carrying patient-derived mutations. Interestingly, while they are able to develop normally, dPRPS mutant flies have a shortened lifespan and locomotive defects, common phenotypes associated with neurodegeneration. Careful analysis of the fat body revealed that patient-derived PRPS mutations result in profound defects in lipolysis, macroautophagy, and lysosome function. Significantly, we show evidence that the nervous system of dPRPS mutant flies is affected by these defects. Overall, we uncovered an unexpected link between nucleotide metabolism and autophagy/lysosome function, providing a possible mechanism by which PRPS-dysfunction contributes to neurological disorders."

Detailed characterization of prescription opioid-induced changes in behavior between 129P3/J and 129S1/SvlmJ mouse substrains.,"Genetic factors are theorized to contribute to the substantial inter-individual variability in opioid abuse/addiction. To advance the behavioral genetics of prescription opioid abuse, our prior work identified the 129S1/SvlmJ (S1) and related 129P3/J (P3) mouse substrains, respectively, as low and high opioid-taking. Herein, we related our prior results to measures of sucrose reward/reinforcement, basal anxiety, opioid-induced place-conditioning, locomotor activity and Straub tail reaction, as well as behavioral and physiological signs of withdrawal. Substrains were also re-examined for higher-dose oxycodone and fentanyl intake under limited-access drinking procedures. S1 mice failed to acquire sucrose self-administration under various operant-conditioning procedures and exhibited lower sucrose intake in the home-cage. However, sucrose intake under limited-access procedures escalated in both substrains with repeated sucrose experience. S1 mice exhibited less spontaneous locomotor activity, as well as less opioid-induced locomotor activity and Straub tail reaction, than P3 mice and failed to exhibit an oxycodone-induced place-preference. The lack of conditioned behavior by S1 mice was unrelated to behavioral signs of withdrawal-induced negative affect or dependence severity, but might reflect high levels of basal anxiety-like behavior. Intriguingly, S1 and P3 mice initially exhibited equivalent oxycodone and fentanyl consumption in the home-cage; however opioid intake escalated only in P3 mice with repeated opioid experience. No sex differences were observed for any of our measures.

N-linoleyltyrosine (NITyr), as an AEA analogue, was synthesized in our laboratory and evaluated the neuroprotective effects and mechanisms for the first time. NITyr was synthesized via substitution reaction. The neuroprotective effects of NITyr were evaluated in a gerbil model of transient cerebral ischemia. Each gerbil was subjected to open field test (OFT), Rotard rod test (RRT), Morris water maze (MWM) successively and executed after animal behaviors. Part of the brain was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Nissl staining, and the rest for biochemical analysis. NITyr could not increase spontaneous locomotor activity and ameliorate the anxiety behavior in the OFT but could improve the motor coordination in the RRT and the spatial memory impairment in the MWM. Immunohistochemically, NITyr could attenuate the ischemia-induced neural loss in the hippocampus. The Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) suggested that NITyr ameliorated the inflammation and oxidative stress. Consistently, NITyr could up-regulate the expressions of p-phosphadylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and p-Akt but not PI3K and Akt in the hippocampus. In addition to oxidative stress, CB2 receptor antagonist AM630 but not CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 could reverse the above phenomena. However, CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 could reverse oxidative stress. Accordingly, NITyr could up-regulate the expressions of CB2 but not CB1. NITyr could improve the motor coordination, learning and memory impairments, neural loss in the hippocampus and the inflammation of the mice via CB2 receptor involvement of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway."

The mechanotransduction regulates several aspects of the cell behavior, including migration, proliferation, and differentiation in a time-dependent manner. Several reports have indicated that cell behavior and fate are not transmitted by a single signal, but rather by an intricate network of many signals operating on different length and timescales that determine cell fate. Since cell biology and biomaterial technology are fundamentals in cell-based regenerative therapies, comprehending the interaction between cells and biomaterials may allow the design of new biomaterials for clinical therapeutic applications in tissue regeneration.

Hence, the development of novel strategies to achieve targeted removal of the aggrecan-hyaluronan pericellular matrix may be effective in treating tendinopathy. The current study examined the therapeutic potential of a recombinant human hyaluronidase, rHuPH20 (FDA approved for reducing HA accumulation in tumors) for treating murine Achilles tendinopathy. 12-week old C57Bl/6 male mice were injected with two doses of rHuTGF-β1 into the retrocalcaneal bursa (RCB) to induce a combined bursitis and tendinopathy. 24 hours following induction of injury, treatment groups were administered rHu-PH20 Hyaluronidase (rHuPH20, Halozyme Therapeutics) into the RCB. At either 6 hours (acute), 9 days, or 25 days following hyaluronidase treatment, Achilles tendons were analyzed for gene expression, histology and immunohistochemistry, fluorophore assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE), and biomechanical properties. rHuPH20 treatment was effective, particularly at the acute and 9-day time points, in (a) removing HA deposits from the Achilles tendon and surrounding tissues, (b) improving biomechanical properties of the healing tendon, and (c) eliciting targeted increases in expression of specific cell fate, ECM metabolism, and inflammatory genes. The potential of rHuPH20 to effectively clear the pro-inflammatory, HA-rich matrix within the RCB and tendon strongly supports the future refinement of injectable glycosidase preparations as potential treatments to protect or regenerate tendon tissue by reducing inflammation and scarring in the presence of bursitis or other inducers of damage such as mechanical overuse.

Consistent with this finding, the particles are enriched in proteins found in focal adhesions, which attach macrophages to the substrate. The release of particles is abolished by blocking cell movement (either by depolymerizing actin with latrunculin A or by inhibiting myosin II with blebbistatin). Confocal microscopy and NanoSIMS imaging studies revealed that the plasma membrane-derived particles are enriched in 'accessible cholesterol' (a mobile pool of cholesterol detectable with the modified cytolysin ALO-D4) but not in sphingolipid-sequestered cholesterol (a pool detectable with ostreolysin A (OlyA)]. The discovery that macrophages release cholesterol-rich particles during cellular locomotion is likely relevant to cholesterol efflux and could contribute to extracellular cholesterol deposition in atherosclerotic plaques."

We have demonstrated previously that blood flow controls the intravascular arrest of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) through stable adhesion to endothelial cells. We now aim to define the contribution of cell adhesion potential and identify adhesion receptors at play. Early arrest is mediated by the formation of weak adhesion, depending on CD44 and integrin αvβ3. Stabilization of this arrest uses integrin α5β1-dependent adhesions with higher adhesion strength, which allows CTCs to stop in vascular regions with lower shear forces. Moreover, blood flow favors luminal deposition of fibronectin on endothelial cells, an integrin α5β1 ligand. Finally, we show that only receptors involved in stable adhesion are required for subsequent extravasation and metastasis. In conclusion, we identified the molecular partners that are sequentially exploited by CTCs to arrest and extravasate in vascular regions with permissive flow regimes."

Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is a risk gene for schizophrenia and a recently developed transgenic mouse model for Nrg1 type III demonstrates a schizophrenia-relevant phenotype. The current study evaluated the behavioural response of Nrg1 type III transgenic mice to high fat diet (HFD) to determine the potential interactive impact of diets and genetic risk factors on disease symptoms. Male and female Nrg1 III and control littermates (N = 13-24) were exposed during adulthood to either HFD or standard chow diet (CHOW) for eight weeks before being tested in behavioural domains relevant to schizophrenia. Locomotion and exploration, anxiety, social behaviours including social preference, sensorimotor gating (i.e. prepulse inhibition, PPI), associative learning, and anhedonia were assessed. HFD increased the body weight gain of mice, suppressed locomotion, exploration, and anxiety-related behaviours in sex-dependent manner. HFD augmented the PPI response in male mice and decreased anhedonia in a sucrose preference test). Finally, HFD had a sex-dependent impact on fear-associated memory with HFD-induced cognitive impairments being most prominent in Nrg1 transgenic females. In conclusion, HFD and mutant Nrg1 III interactively impair particular cognitive domains in a sex-specific manner. Thus, our preclinical data suggest that genetic predisposition to the schizophrenia risk gene NRG1 may modulate detrimental behavioural effects of diets. This indicates the importance to research further the role of particular diets in the context of populations at risk to develop schizophrenia."

This ability is highly desirable for technical applications. The morphology of the fish's suction disc and its ability to attach to rough and slimy surfaces have been described before, and here we aim to close gaps in the biomechanical understanding, and transfer the biomechanical principles to technical suction cups. We demonstrate that the margin of the suction disc is the critical feature enabling attachment to rough surfaces. Second, friction measurements show that friction of the disc rim is increased on rough substrates and contributes to high tenacity. Increased friction causes a delay in failure of the suction cup and increases the attachment force. We were able to implement these concepts to develop the first suction cups bioinspired by Northern clingfish. These cups attach with tenacities up to 70 kPa on surfaces as rough as 270 µm grain size. The application of this technology is promising in fields such as surgery, industrial production processes and whale tagging.

Muscle force generating capacity, tendon stiffness, elastic energy storage capacity and efficiency were calculated from muscle and tendon morphological parameters and <i>in vitro</i> tendon mechanical properties obtained from a growth series of ostrich cadavers. Ontogenetic scaling relationships were established using reduced major axis regression analysis. Ostrich pelvic limb muscle mass and cross-sectional area broadly scaled with positive allometry, indicating maintained or relatively greater capacity for maximum isometric force generation in larger animals. The length of distal limb tendons was found to scale with positive allometry in several tendons associated with antigravity support and elastic energy storage during locomotion. Distal limb tendon stiffness scaled with negative allometry with respect to body mass, with tendons being relatively more compliant in larger birds. Tendon material properties also appeared to be size-dependent, suggesting that the relative increased compliance of tendons in larger ostriches is due in part to compensatory distortions in tendon material properties during maturation and development, not simply from ontogenetic changes in tendon geometry. Our results suggest that the previously reported increase in locomotor economy through ontogeny in the ostrich is due to greater potential for elastic energy storage with increasing body size. In fact, the rate of this increase may be somewhat greater than the conservative predictions of previous studies, thus illustrating the biological importance of elastic tendon structures in adult ostriches."

To implement this in an aquatic robot, one may actively control the surface area of its legs during the swimming. However, a small sized robot with a limited number of actuators should adjust the surface area of legs in passive manner. For this reason, we proposed a novel articulated leg with flexible appendages inspired by a water beetle. These leg structures were designed to implement an efficient recovery stroke with less resistive force during the recovery stroke, while its surface area was increased again if suitable relaxation time was applied to perform improved power stroke. To identify an optimal leg design, 36 different types were fabricated by changing the passive joint thickness, appendage materials, length, and morphology. Several correlations and dominant parameters were identified, and it was shown that the swimming leg with fixed joint and appendage stiffness cannot always generate the largest torque in all the swimming frequency. Also, a two-dimensional dynamic model was proposed based on an underactuated manipulator, and the model validation was proceeded by comparing with two selected leg designs. In addition, a 5.5 cm long robot with one pair of legs was built to further investigate their locomotory performance. By varying the beating frequency and relaxation time, thorough analysis was addressed in terms of the position, velocity, non-dimensional traveled distance, Strouhal number, and quasi-propulsive efficiency. Here, some important relationships between dimensionless numbers were established. Furthermore, it was found that introducing a relaxation phase between the power stroke and recovery stroke can increase the traveled distance per stroke with slight expense of propulsive efficiency."

Four commercial CP products with different carbon chain lengths and chlorine contents were employed to investigate and compare the possible neurotoxic effects on zebrafish larvae at 5 days post fertilization using behavioral tests, including locomotion, path angle, and two-fish social interaction. The high-chlorinated short-chain CP-70 product resulted in the strongest effects in all three tests, while the low-chlorinated long-chain CP-42 product was on the other end of the spectrum. The consequences of the chain length of two CP-52 products could be clearly distinguished by the tests. Although exposure to the two products both caused inhibition in the locomotion test, they resulted in different kinds of effects in the path angle and interaction tests. Our results suggested, as evidenced by the sensitivity and resolution of the behavioral tests, that the influence of the chain length and chlorine content of CPs could be well characterized and that chlorine content consistently showed a more significant impact than chain length. The health threats of long-chain CPs could also not be overlooked when they contained relatively high chlorine contents."

The objective of this review was to explore the interaction between play and tissue (bone) development at a molecular through to whole-animal level, with specific focus on the horse as a model. The basis of our understanding of the response of bone to loading is the mechanostat theorem. This assumes that at a tissue level, bone attempts to keep localised strain within the physiological range of 1500-2500 microstrain. Loads above this range result in a modelling response to reduce strain, and strain below this threshold results in remodelling to maintain the localised physiological range. In foals, locomotor play is dramatic and vigorous, with cumulative increases in both intensity and complexity. Based on published literature describing locomotor play in foals and the microstrain at different gaits in the horse, it was proposed that locomotor play in foal aligns with the mechanostat theorem in both the magnitude and frequency of load cycles applied. The cumulative increases in the complexity and intensity of locomotor play as the foal develops, in turn, ensure the strain rates associated with play remain above the local physiological range and promote material and architectural changes in the distal limb bones. Thus, spontaneous locomotor play may be vital to ensure optimal bone development in the horse. Modern management systems need to provide appropriate opportunities for foals to perform spontaneous locomotor play to optimise bone development and reduce the risk of future musculoskeletal injury later in life."

Many kinetic species possess a particular suite of features to accomplish this movement, including flexible cranial joints and protractor musculature. Whereas the musculoskeletal anatomy of these kinetic systems is well understood, how these joints are biomechanically loaded, how different soft tissues affect joint loading and kinetic capacity, and how the protractor musculature loads the skull remain poorly understood. Here we present a Finite Element Model of the savannah monitor, <i>Varanus exanthematicus</i>, a modestly kinetic lizard, to better elucidate the roles of soft tissue in mobile joints and protractor musculature on cranial loading. We describe the 3D resultants of jaw muscles and the histology of palatobasal, otic and jaw joints. We tested the effects of joint tissue types, bite point, and muscle loads to evaluate the biomechanical role of muscles on the palate and braincase. We found the jaw muscles have significant mediolateral components that can impart stability across palatocranial joints. We found articular tissues affect the magnitude of strains experienced around the palatobasal and otic joints. We found that without protractor muscle loading, the palate, quadrate and braincase experience higher strains suggesting this muscle helps insulate the braincase and palatoquadrate from high loads. Finally, we found the cross-sectional properties of the bones of <i>Varanus exanthematicus</i> are well suited for performing under torsional loads. These findings suggest that torsional loading regimes may have played a more important role in the evolution of cranial kinesis in lepidosaurs than previously appreciated."

In this paper, we investigated the correlations of habitat preferences and morphological traits in larval Panorpidae in the phylogenetic context to unravel the driving forces underlying the evolution of morphological traits. The results show that most anatomical features are shared by monophyletic groups and are synapomorphies. However, the phenotypes of body colorations are shared by paraphyletic assemblages, implying that they are adaptive characters. The larvae of Dicerapanorpa and Cerapanorpa are epedaphic and are darkish dorsally as camouflage, and possess well-developed locomotory appendages as adaptations likely to avoid potential predators. On the contrary, the larvae of Neopanorpa are euedaphic and are pale on their trunks, with shallow furrows, reduced antennae, shortened setae, flattened compound eyes on the head capsules, and short dorsal processes on the trunk. All these characters appear to be adaptations for the larvae to inhabit the soil. We suggest that habitat divergence has driven the morphological diversity between the epedaphic and euedaphic larvae, and may be partly responsible for the divergence of major clades within the Panorpidae."

Cellulose-enriched secondary cell walls are the hallmark of woody vascular plants, which develop thickened walls to support upright growth and resist toppling in terrestrial environments. Here we investigate the striking presence and convergent evolution of cellulosic secondary walls in coralline red algae, which reinforce thalli against forces applied by crashing waves. Despite ostensible similarities to secondary wall synthesis in land plants, we note several structural and mechanical differences. In coralline red algae, secondary walls contain three-times more cellulose (~ 22% w/w) than primary walls (~ 8% w/w), and their presence nearly doubles the total thickness of cell walls (~ 1.2 µm thick). Field emission scanning electron microscopy revealed that cellulose bundles are cylindrical and lack any predominant orientation in both primary and secondary walls. His-tagged recombinant carbohydrate-binding module differentiated crystalline and amorphous cellulose in planta, noting elevated levels of crystalline cellulose in secondary walls. With the addition of secondary cell walls, Calliarthron genicular tissues become significantly stronger and tougher, yet remain remarkably extensible, more than doubling in length before breaking under tension. Thus, the development of secondary walls contributes to the strong-yet-flexible genicular tissues that enable coralline red algae to survive along wave-battered coastlines throughout the NE Pacific. This study provides an important evolutionary perspective on the development and biomechanical significance of secondary cell walls in a non-model, non-vascular plant."

In this study, we demonstrate that no treadmill serves as an inertial frame of reference. Considering the linear momentum principle, the finite sampling rate of the controller, and the limited power of the treadmill motor, we predict that 1) the error of the treadmill speed periodically varies depending on the locomotion phase and 2) this non-ideal behavior becomes more evident as the locomotion speed or the weight of the walker increases. Experimental observation confirmed our predictions by quantifying the variation of the actual treadmill belt speed and the ground reaction force in the anterior-posterior direction for different locomotion speeds and subject weights. These results emphasize a need for design criteria like the minimum sampling rate and the minimum motor power that treadmill locomotion studies should consider."

Series B, Biological sciences*",* [Dynamic biological adhesion: mechanisms for controlling attachment during locomotion.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31495309),Dynamic biological adhesion: mechanisms for controlling attachment during locomotion.,"The rapid control of surface attachment is a key feature of natural adhesive systems used for locomotion, and a property highly desirable for man-made adhesives. Here, we describe the challenges of adhesion control and the timescales involved across diverse biological attachment systems and different adhesive mechanisms. The most widespread control principle for dynamic surface attachment in climbing animals is that adhesion is 'shear-sensitive' (directional): pulling adhesive pads towards the body results in strong attachment, whereas pushing them away from it leads to easy detachment, providing a rapid mechanical 'switch'. Shear-sensitivity is based on changes of contact area and adhesive strength, which in turn arise from non-adhesive default positions, the mechanics of peeling, pad sliding, and the targeted storage and controlled release of elastic strain energy. The control of adhesion via shear forces is deeply integrated with the climbing animals' anatomy and locomotion, and involves both active neuromuscular control, and rapid passive responses of sophisticated mechanical systems. The resulting dynamic adhesive systems are robust, reliable, versatile and nevertheless remarkably simple. This article is part of the theme issue 'Transdisciplinary approaches to the study of adhesion and adhesives in biological systems'."

The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of sagittal placement of the femoral component on tibiofemoral (TF) kinematics and kinetics in CR-TKA. Five sagittal placements of femoral component models with -3, 0, 3, 5, and 7 degrees of flexion are developed. The TF joint kinematics, quadriceps force, patellofemoral contact force, and posterior cruciate ligament force are evaluated using the models under deep knee-bend loading. The kinematics of posterior TF translation is found to occur with the increase in femoral-component flexion. The quadriceps force and patellofemoral contact force decrease with the femoral-component flexion increase. In addition, extension of the femoral component increases with the increase in posterior cruciate ligament force. The flexed femoral component in CR-TKA provides a positive biomechanical effect compared with a neutral position. Slight flexion could be an effective alternative technique to enable positive biomechanical effects with TKA prostheses."

Thus, this study recruited 90 participants (61 with no history of LBP, and 29 with) to sit for 1 hour where back electromyography, spine posture, and perceived pain ratings (PPR) were collected. Participants were classified as Pain Developers (PD) or Non-Pain Developers (NPD) based on their maximum PPR. PDs had significantly higher PPR (p = 0.000) and lower number of spine fidgets (p = 0.004) than NPDs. There was a significant interaction between clinical health history and pain group (p = 0.037) for PPR. Besides fidget frequency, there were no biomechanical differences between pain groups. Therefore, sitting-induced back pain does not appear to be due to posture or muscle activity; however, it may be related to micro-movement strategies. Future work should explore fidgeting further and whether healthy PDs are at risk for clinical LBP in the future. <b>Practitioner Summary:</b> We have replicated the differential transient sitting-induced pain response observed in previous studies. Pain developers do not sit differently than non-pain developers, although they do appear to move less. More research is warranted to better understand these groups and the relationship between pain developers and future cases of back pain."

Herein, by introducing the synthesis of active ""patchy"" colloids of various low-symmetry shapes, we demonstrate that the dynamics of such systems can be precisely tuned. The low-symmetry patchy colloids are made in bulk via a cluster-encapsulation-dewetting method. They carry essential information encoded in their shapes (particle geometry, number, size, and configurations of surface patches, etc.) that programs their locomotive and assembling behaviors. Under AC electric field, we show that the velocity of particle propulsion and the ability to brake and steer can be modulated by having two asymmetrical patches with various bending angles. The assembly of monopatch particles leads to the formation of dynamic and reconfigurable structures such as spinners and ""cooperative swimmers"" depending on the particle's aspect ratios. A particle with two patches of different sizes allows for ""directional bonding"", a concept popular in static assemblies but rare in dynamic ones. With the capability to make tunable and complex shapes, we anticipate the discovery of a diverse range of new dynamics and structures when other external stimuli (e.g., magnetic, optical, chemical, etc.) are employed and spark synergy with shapes."

This review provides an overview of the challenges involved in developing finite element models of the tibiofemoral joint, including the representation of appropriate geometry and material properties, loads and motions, and establishing pertinent outputs. The importance of validation for computational models in biomechanics has been highlighted by a number of papers, and finite element models of the tibiofemoral joint are a particular area in which validation can be challenging, due to the complex nature of the knee joint, its geometry and its constituent tissue properties. A variety of study designs have emerged to tackle these challenges, and these can be categorised into several different types. The role of validation, and the strategies adopted by these different study types, are discussed. Models representing trends and sensitivities often utilise generic representations of the knee and provide conclusions with relevance to general populations, usually without explicit validation. Models representing in vitro specimens or in vivo subjects can, to varying extents, be more explicitly validated, and their conclusions are more subject-specific. The potential for these approaches to examine the effects of patient variation is explored, which could lead to future applications in defining how treatments may be stratified for subgroups of patients."

Bryophyllum pinnatum (Lam.) Oken of the family Crassulaceae is traditionally used in the treatment of diseases, such as cough, wounds, and kidney diseases. This study evaluates the effect of the aqueous extract of B. pinnatum (AEBP) leaves on acetylcholinesterase activity in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced short-term memory impairment in rats. Methods Thirty male Wistar albino rats were used in this study and were divided into six groups (n=5). Group I served as control, group II rats were induced with CCl4, while groups III-V animals were pretreated with silymarin (25 mg/kg body weight), 25 and 50 mg/kg body weight AEBP leaves, respectively, once daily by oral gavage for 14 days prior to a single intraperitoneal injection of CCl4. Animals in group VI received 50 mg/kg body weight AEBP only by oral gavage. Results Administration of carbon tetrachloride significantly increased (p<0.05) spontaneous alternation and locomotor function in rats when compared with the control group. Also, the levels of acetylcholinesterase, adenosine deaminase, and malondialdehyde were increased in CCl4-administered rats, with reduction in both enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant levels. However, pretreatment of rats with AEBP leaves, at tested doses, prevented these changes. Conclusions The increased antioxidant status and the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity show that AEBP leaves improve learning memory and stabilizes memory impairment caused by CCl4."

These receptors undergo intracellular trafficking processes that are modulated by dysbindin-1 (Dys). Indeed, Dys variants alter cognitive responses to antipsychotic drugs through D2-mediated mechanisms. However, the mechanism by which Dys might selectively interfere with the D3 receptor subtype is unknown. Here, we revealed an interaction between functional genetic variants altering Dys and D3. Specifically, both in patients with schizophrenia and in genetically modified mice, concomitant reduction in D3 and Dys functionality was associated with improved executive and working memory abilities. This D3/Dys interaction produced a D2/D3 imbalance favoring increased D2 signaling in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) but not in the striatum. No epistatic effects on the clinical positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) scores were evident, while only marginal effects on sensorimotor gating, locomotor functions, and social behavior were observed in mice.

One of the best-studied models is the prematurely aging mtDNA mutator mouse, which carries a homozygous knock-in of a proofreading deficient version of the catalytic subunit of mtDNA polymerase-γ (PolgA). We investigated how voluntary exercise affects the progression of aging phenotypes in this mouse, focusing on mitochondrial and protein homeostasis in both brain and peripheral tissues. Voluntary exercise significantly ameliorated several aspects of the premature aging phenotype, including decreased locomotor activity, alopecia, and kyphosis, but did not have major effects on the decreased lifespan of mtDNA mutator mice. Exercise also decreased the mtDNA mutation load. In-depth tissue proteomics revealed that exercise normalized the levels of about half the proteins, with the majority involved in mitochondrial function and nuclear-mitochondrial crosstalk. There was also a specific increase in the nuclear-encoded proteins needed for the tricarboxylic acid cycle and complex II, but not in mitochondrial-encoded oxidative phosphorylation proteins, as well as normalization of enzymes involved in coenzyme Q biosynthesis. Furthermore, we found tissue-specific alterations, with brain coping better as compared to muscle and with motor cortex being better protected than striatum, in response to mitochondrial dysfunction. We conclude that voluntary exercise counteracts aging in mtDNA mutator mice by counteracting protein dysregulation in muscle and brain, decreasing the mtDNA mutation burden in muscle, and delaying overt aging phenotypes."

Here, microRNA-26b (miR-26b) expression in the spinal cord tissues of SCI rats was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. The influences of miR-26b on locomotor recovery following SCI were assessed utilizing Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores. The effects of miR-26b on OPC differentiation were explored using immunofluorescence and western blot analyses in vitro and in vivo. The potential targets that are modulated by miR-26b were identified by bioinformatics, luciferase reporter assays, and western blot analyses. The effects of adrenomedullin (ADM) on OPC differentiation were explored in vitro using immunofluorescence and western blot analyses. We demonstrated that miR-26b was significantly downregulated after SCI. BBB scores showed that miR-26b exacerbated the locomotor function deficits induced by SCI. In vitro, miR-26b inhibited the differentiation of primary rat OPCs. In vivo, miR-26b suppressed OPC differentiation in SCI rats. Bioinformatics analyses and experimental detection revealed that miR-26b directly targeted ADM in OPCs. In addition, knockdown of ADM suppressed the differentiation of primary rat OPCs. Our study provides evidence that ADM may mediate miR-26b-inhibited OPC differentiation in SCI."

Our study was conducted to investigate whether GS Rg1 confers an antidepressant effect in rats exposed to a chronic unpredictable mild stress model of depression and to explore its possible mechanisms. Our results revealed that GS Rg1 treatments for 3 weeks alleviated the depression-related behaviors of chronic unpredictable mild stress-exposed rats, as indicated by increasing sucrose preference, improving locomotor activity and shortening immobile time in both the forced swimming tests and tail suspension tests. And these ameliorative effects of GS Rg1 treatment were involved with regulating chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin beta (IL-1β) related neuro-inflammation. In addition, we further found that GS Rg1 reversed chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced IL-1β elevation, possibly by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B pathway activation and regulating nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 inflammasome expression. In short, our results suggested that GS Rg1 exerted a potential antidepressant-like effect in chronic unpredictable mild stress rat model of depression, which may provide an insight into the potential of GS Rg1 in therapeutic implications for depression."

In order to isolate the response of the salivary glands to delivered dose, from deformation due to patient position, it is important to resolve the patient postural changes, mainly due to neck flexion. In this study we evaluate the use of a biomechanical model-based deformable image registration (DIR) algorithm to estimate the displacements and deformations of the salivary glands due to postural changes. A total of 82 pairs of CT images of HN cancer patients with varying angles of neck flexion were retrospectively obtained. The pairs of CTs of each patient were aligned using bone-based rigid registration. The images were then deformed using biomechanical model-based DIR method that focused on the mandible, C1 vertebrae, C3 vertebrae, and external contour. For comparison, an intensity-based DIR was also performed. The accuracy of the biomechanical model-based DIR was assessed using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for all images and for the subset of images where the PGs had a volume change within 20%. The accuracy was compared to the intensity-based DIR. The PG mean  ±  STD DSC were 0.63  ±  0.18, 0.80  ±  0.08, and 0.82  ±  0.15 for the rigid registration, biomechanical model-based DIR, and intensity based DIR, respectively, for patients with a PG volume change up to 20%. For the entire cohort of patients, where the PG volume change was up to 57%, the PG mean  ±  STD DSC were 0.60  ±  0.18, 0.78  ±  0.09, and 0.81  ±  0.14 for the rigid registration, biomechanical model-based DIR, and intensity based DIR, respectively. The difference in DSC of the intensity and biomechanical model-based DIR methods was not statistically significant when the volume change was less than 20% (two-sided paired t-test, p   =  0.12). When all volume changes were considered, there was a significant difference between the two registration approaches, although the magnitude was small. These results demonstrate that the proposed biomechanical model with boundary conditions on the bony anatomy can serve to describe the varying angles of neck flexion appearing in images during radiation treatment and to align the salivary glands for proper analysis of dose-response relationships. It also motivates the need for dose response modeling following neck flexion for cases where parotid gland response is noted."

Various morphologies are formed because of various spatiotemporal combinations and sequences of multicellular activities. Despite its potential to variations, morphogenesis is a surprisingly robust process, in which qualitatively similar morphologies are reproducibly formed even under spatiotemporal fluctuation of multicellular activities. To understand these essential characteristics of tissue morphogenesis, which involves the coexistence of various morphologies and robustness of the morphogenetic process, in this study, we propose a novel approach to capture the overall view of morphogenesis from mechanical viewpoints. This approach will enable visualization of the energy landscape, which includes morphogenetic processes induced by admissible histories of cellular activities. This approach was applied to investigate the morphogenesis of a sheet-like tissue with curvature, where it deformed to a concave or convex morphology depending on the history of growth and constriction. Qualitatively different morphologies were produced by bifurcation of the valley in the energy landscape. The depth and steepness of the valley near the stable states represented the degree of robustness to fluctuations of multicellular activities. Furthermore, as a realistic example, we showed an application of this approach to luminal folding observed in the initial stage of intestinal villus formation. This approach will be helpful to understand the mechanism of how various morphologies are formed and how tissues reproducibly achieve specific morphologies."

However, behavioral assessments, in combination with objective long-term monitoring, is difficult. In this study, we introduced an automated video tracking system which was previously used in rodent studies, for use with pig models. Locomotor behaviors (total distance, number of zone transitions, and velocity) were evaluated and their changes were validated by different MPTP administration methods and dosing regimens. Three minipigs (23-29 kg) received subcutaneous or intravenous MPTP, either 1 or 3 times per week. Immediately after MPTP injection, the minipigs remained in a corner and exhibited reduced trajectory. In addition, the total distance travelled, number of zone transitions, and velocity were greatly reduced at every MPTP administration in all the minipigs, accompanying to increased resting time. However, the MPTP-induced symptoms were reversed when MPTP administration was terminated. In conclusion, this automated video-tracking system was able to monitor long-term locomotor activity and differentiate detailed alterations in large animals. It has the advantages of being easy to use, higher resolution, less effort, and more delicate tracking. Additionally, as our method can be applied to the animals' home pen, no habituation is needed."
impact silencing feed forward parvalbumin expressing inhibitory interneurons cortico thalamocortical network seizure generation behaviour,NEURAL,43.4% SPORT/EXERCISE; 27.0% GAIT/LOCOMOTION; 6.0% REHABILITATION,"Panthi S, Leitch B,",*Neurobiology of disease*,* [The impact of silencing feed-forward parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons in the cortico-thalamocortical network on seizure generation and behaviour.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31494287),The impact of silencing feed-forward parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons in the cortico-thalamocortical network on seizure generation and behaviour.,"Feed-forward inhibition (FFI) is an essential mechanism within the brain to regulate neuronal firing and prevent runaway excitation. In the cortico-thalamocortical (CTC) network, fast spiking parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) inhibitory interneurons regulate the firing of pyramidal cells in the cortex and relay neurons in the thalamus. PV+ interneuron dysfunction has been implicated in several neurological disorders, including epilepsy. Previously, we demonstrated that loss of excitatory AMPA-receptors, specifically at synapses on PV+ interneuron in CTC feedforward microcircuits, occurs in the stargazer mouse model of absence epilepsy. These mice present with absence seizures characterized by spike and wave discharges (SWDs) on EEG and concomitant behavioural arrest similar to childhood absence epilepsy. The aim of the current study was to investigate the impact of loss of FFI within the CTC on absence seizure generation and behaviour using new Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADD) technology. We crossed PV-Cre mice with Cre-dependent hM4Di DREADD strains of mice, which allowed Cre-recombinase-mediated restricted expression of G<sub>i</sub>-DREADDs in PV+ interneurons. We then tested the impact of global and focal (within the CTC network) silencing of PV+ interneurons. CNO mediated silencing of all PV+ interneurons by intraperitoneal injection caused the impairment of motor control, decreased locomotion and increased anxiety in a dose-dependent manner. Such silencing generated pathological oscillations similar to absence-like seizures. Focal silencing of PV+ interneurons within cortical or thalamic feedforward microcircuits, induced SWD-like oscillations and associated behavioural arrest without any impact on anxiety. Epileptiform activity on EEG appeared significantly sooner after focal injection compared to peripheral injection of CNO. However, the mean duration of each oscillatory burst and spike frequency was similar, irrespective of mode of CNO delivery. No significant changes were observed in vehicle-treated or non-DREADD wild-type control animals. These data suggest that dysfunctional feedforward inhibition in CTC microcircuits may be an important target for future therapy strategies for some patients with absence seizures. Additionally, silencing of PV+ interneurons in other brain regions may contribute to anxiety related neurological and psychiatric disorders."

However, the influence of the training on the spinal interneurons remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the training effects on spinal interneurons in dorsal and ventromedial area in mice (P42-P50). The electrophysiological properties of the interneurons were recorded from spinal cord slices (T13-L6) by whole-cell patch-clamp recording. The interneurons could be classified into three types based on their response to step currents: single spike (type 1), phasic firing (type 2), and tonic firing (type 3) in both control and trained mice. Interneurons collected from control mice possessed rheobase of 11.3 ± 6.0 pA and voltage threshold (V<sub>th</sub>) of - 37.3 ± 4.7 mV. Treadmill training reduced the rheobase by 4.8 ± 1.5 pA and V<sub>th</sub> by 3.1 ± 1.2 mV (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the training effects were dependent on the distribution and types of the interneurons. Treadmill training hyperpolarized V<sub>th</sub> and decreased rheobase in ventromedial interneurons, while the significant change was observed only in the action potation height of the interneurons in dorsal horn. Treadmill training also hyperpolarized V<sub>th</sub> and increased input resistance in type 3 interneurons, but none of these changes was shown in type 1 and 2 interneurons. Bath application of 5-HT (10-20 μM) increased the neuronal excitability in both control and trained mice. Serotonin had similar effect on membrane properties of the interneurons collected from both groups. This study suggested that treadmill training increased excitability of spinal interneurons of the mice and thus would make the spinal motor system easier to generate locomotion."

While TLR7/8 agonists have robust therapeutic potential, clinical utility of these agents is limited by sickness responses associated with treatment induction. To understand the kinetics and mechanism of these responses, we characterized the acute and chronic effects of TLR7 stimulation. Single-cell RNA-sequencing studies, RNAscope, and radiolabeled in situ hybridization demonstrate that central nervous system gene expression of TLR7 is exclusive to microglia. In vitro studies demonstrate that microglia are highly sensitive to TLR7 stimulation, and respond in a dose-dependent manner to the imidazoquinoline R848. In vivo, both intraperitoneal (IP) and intracerebroventricular (ICV) R848 induce acute sickness responses including hypophagia, weight loss, and decreased voluntary locomotor activity, associated with increased CNS pro-inflammatory gene expression and changes to glial morphology. However, chronic daily IP R848 resulted in rapid tachyphylaxis of behavioral and molecular manifestations of illness. In microglial in vitro assays, pro-inflammatory transcriptional responses rapidly diminished in the context of repeated R848. In addition to TLR7 desensitization, we found that microglia become partially refractory to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) following R848 pretreatment, associated with induction of negative regulators A20 and Irak3. Similarly, mice pre-treated with R848 demonstrate reduced sickness responses, hypothalamic inflammation, and hepatic inflammation in response to LPS. These data combined demonstrate that TLR7 stimulation induces acute behavioral and molecular evidence of sickness responses. Following prolonged dosing, R848 induces a refractory state to both TLR7 and TLR4 activation, consistent with induced immune tolerance."

We have applied super-resolved microscopy to quantify the intracellular, spatial reorganization of H-NS in response to a rapid osmotic shift. We find that H-NS shows a growth phase dependent re-localization in response to hyperosmotic shock. In stationary phase, H-NS detaches from a tightly compacted bacterial chromosome and is excluded from the nucleoid volume over an extended period of time. This behaviour is absent during rapid growth but may be induced by exposing the osmotically stressed culture to the DNA gyrase inhibitor, coumermycin. This chromosomal compaction/H-NS exclusion phenomenon occurs in the presence of either potassium or sodium ions and is independent of the stress responsive sigma factor σ <sup>S</sup>, or the H-NS paralog StpA.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The heat-stable nucleoid-structuring (H-NS) protein coordinates the expression of over 200 genes in E. coli, a vast many involved in both bacterial virulence and drug resistance. We report on the novel observation of a dynamic compaction of the bacterial chromosome in response to being exposed to high levels of salt. This stress response results in the detachment of H-NS proteins and their subsequent expulsion to the periphery of the cells. We found this behavior is related to mechanical properties of the bacterial chromosome, in particular, how tightly twisted and coiled is the chromosomal DNA. This behavior might act as a biomechanical response to stress that coordinates the expression of genes involved in adapting bacteria to a salty environment."

Yet no effective treatments exist. Moreover, anorexia lacks adolescent animal models, contributing to a poor understanding of underlying age-specific neurophysiological disruptions. To evaluate the contribution of dopaminergic signaling to the emergence of anorexia-related behaviors during the vulnerable adolescent period, we applied an established adult activity-based anorexia (ABA) paradigm (food restriction plus unlimited exercise access for 4-5 days) to adult and adolescent rats of both sexes. At the end of the paradigm, measures of plasma volume, blood hormone levels, dopamine transporter (DAT) expression and function, acute cocaine-induced locomotion, and brain water weight were taken. Adolescents were dramatically more affected by the ABA paradigm than adults in all measures. In vivo chronoamperometry, and cocaine locomotor responses revealed sex-specific changes in adolescent DAT function after ABA that were independent of DAT expression differences. Hematocrit, insulin, ghrelin, and corticosterone levels did not resemble shifts typically observed in patients with anorexia, though decreases in leptin levels aligned with human reports. These findings are the first to suggest that food restriction in conjunction with excessive exercise sex-dependently and age-specifically modulate DAT functional plasticity during adolescence. The adolescent vulnerability to this relatively short manipulation, combined with blood measures, evidence need for an optimized age-appropriate ABA paradigm with greater face and predictive validity for study of the pathophysiology and treatment of anorexia. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Adolescent rats exhibit a distinctive, sex-specific plasticity in dopamine transporter function and cocaine response after food restriction and exercise access that is both absent in adults and not attributable to changes in dopamine transporter expression levels. These novel findings may help explain sex differences in vulnerability to eating disorders and drug abuse during adolescence."

Remarkably, HdhQ200/200 mice of both sexes exhibit comparable impaired spontaneous locomotion and motor coordination at 10 months of age and reach moribund stage by 12 months of age, demonstrating reduced life span in this model system. Histopathological analysis revealed enhanced mutant huntingtin protein aggregation in male HdhQ200/200 striatal tissue at 8 months of age compared to female HdhQ200/200. Functional analysis of calcium dynamics in MSNs of female HdhQ200/200 mice using GCaMP6m imaging revealed elevated responses to excitatory cortical-striatal stimulation suggesting increased MSN excitability.

Spine compression forces differed by as much as 5.5 times bodyweight between individuals performing identical tasks.

Large variations in spine load magnitudes were documented regardless of whether simple or advanced quantification methods were used.

Thus, personalised ergonomic interventions are warranted to regulate spine loading and load tolerance in firefighters. <b>Practitioner summary:</b> Even when performing the same work, the associated spine loading demands will vary widely across people due to differences in their body sizes, shapes, and movement strategies. Therefore, personalised interventions are needed to regulate spine loading and load tolerance in workers (e.g. obesity prevention, physical capacity-building exercise, and movement [re]training)."

Individuals with extensive soccer experience display superior static single leg balance control compared to athletes of other sports as well as non-athletes. However, during a match, players often encounter greater challenges to single leg balance that require rapid decision-making skills and dynamic stability. <b>Purpose</b>: The purpose of this study was to determine if individuals with extensive soccer training demonstrate superior single-leg balance control compared to non-athletes during a dynamic lower limb reaching task. <b>Method</b>: 22 varsity soccer players were matched with 21 non-athlete controls. Single-leg balance control was assessed during a Go/No-Go lower limb reaching task. Centre of pressure displacement (dCOP) was measured for both the dominant and non-dominant feet and compared between groups. <b>Results</b>: Soccer players displayed reduced dCOP during All Go trials compared to non-athletes, particularly in the medial-lateral plane. Additionally, soccer players displayed reduced anterior-posterior dCOP during Go/No-Go trials compared to non-athletes, particularly on their dominant foot. <b>Conclusion</b>: Athletes with soccer-specific training demonstrate improved executive control and use of proprioceptive information, which results in an improved ability to maintain single-support balance and corral COP during a dynamic visuomotor lower limb-reaching task. As such, balance training may be a useful addition to athlete training regimes to improve sport-specific performance. Future research would compare these results to athletes of other sports to explore balance control during a visuomotor reaching task and how it may differ based on sport training history."

For every 10 calories burned, less than 1 is needed to maintain a constant forward velocity - the remaining energy is, in a sense, wasted. The majority of this wasted energy is expended to support the bodyweight and redirect the center of mass during the stance phase of gait. An order of magnitude less energy is expended to brake and accelerate the swinging leg. Accordingly, most devices designed to increase running efficiency have targeted the costlier stance phase of gait. An alternative approach is seen in nature: spring-like tissues in some animals and humans are believed to assist leg swing. While it has been assumed that such a spring simply offloads the muscles that swing the legs, thus saving energy, this mechanism has not been experimentally investigated. Here, we show that a spring, or 'exotendon', connecting the legs of a human reduces the energy required for running by 6.4±2.8%, and does so through a complex mechanism that produces savings beyond those associated with leg swing. The exotendon applies assistive forces to the swinging legs, increasing the energy optimal stride frequency. Runners then adopt this frequency, taking faster and shorter strides, and reduce the joint mechanical work to redirect their center of mass. Our study shows how a simple spring improves running economy through a complex interaction between the changing dynamics of the body and the adaptive strategies of the runner, highlighting the importance of considering each when designing systems that couple human and machine."

The aim of this work was to examine the secular trends in the body dimensions of professional handball players using cohorts from 1977 and 2012. A range of anthropometric data was considered, including skinfold-, height-, length-, breadth-, and girth-based measures. We computed various body indices and the endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy components. Above-average height was exhibited by both cohorts, and the trends observed in body height and the other height-related variables are in line with those reported for the general population. Remaining anthropometric differences between the two cohorts can be attributed to morphological optimization, as changes in handball regulations between 1977 and 2012 modified game play dynamics and therefore motor requirements. The changes in trunk and lower extremity proportions have resulted in a contemporary handball player with a lower center of mass and enhanced biomechanical conditions of movements that can translate into improved speed, change-of-direction ability, jumping, and balance skills. Additionally, an increase in upper body dimensions may be advantageous in handball due to the close contact nature of the game. Increases in bone breadths and segment girths as well as a reduction in subcutaneous fat tissue appear to be the result of systematic strength training."

Based on this challenge, Bernstein (1967) viewed skill development as the process whereby the central nervous system (CNS) gains mastery of kinematic DOF and kinetic reactional elements (passive forces, moments etc.), with the highest level of skill characterised by optimal exploitation of reactional elements in the achievement of movement goals. A previous kinematic investigation into coordination differences in a complex multidirectional dance sequence demonstrated that general unfreezing of kinematic DOF occurred as dance skill progressed (Chang et al., submitted for publication). To gain insight into the role of angular reactional elements in skill, the present kinetic study investigated angular momentum and associated variables across three skill levels (beginners, intermediates, experts) within this same complex dance sequence. The results showed that the angular momenta of segments and accompanying angular reactional elements generally increased with skill level. More specifically, the findings suggested that while improvements in movement economy from cancellation of angular momentum between body segments occur early in skill progression, later in skill progression, experts utilise increased whole-body angular momentum. Although this is energetically expensive, it may enhance the aesthetic value of dance movements, and/or have mechanical advantages. Overall, the findings here provide support for Bernstein's (1967) model of skill development. Future research should quantify the relations between energy expenditure, key biomechanical variables that reflect skill and dance aesthetics as perceived by audiences."

An examination of the relationship between the functional movement screen, landing error scoring system and 3D kinematic data during a drop jump task. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Tests such as the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) and Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) have become an established component of preparticipation screening. Despite their practical use, there is a lack of empirical evidence examining their relationship to established assessments of movement, such as 3D kinematics of a drop jump. Fifty-two male collegiate athletes undertook the LESS, FMS, and a drop jump where 3D lower-limb kinematic variables were assessed. Spearman correlations were conducted to examine the relationship between LESS, FMS, and drop-jump 3D kinematic variables. A series of independent t-tests examined differences in hip and knee kinematic variables in acceptable and poor FMS and LESS groups as determined by established cut-off scores. Landing Error Scoring System scores had significant moderate correlations with most kinematic variables (r = 0.35-0.64; p < 0.01). Subjects with poor LESS scores displayed significantly worse lower-limb kinematics compared with their high-scoring counterparts (effect size = 1.99-2.76, large effect). There were significant moderate correlations with maximal hip and knee flexion (r = 0.46 and 0.39 respectively; p < 0.01) and small or nonsignificant correlations between all other kinematic variables and FMS scores. Hip flexion and knee valgus at maximal displacement were the only kinematic variables significantly different between FMS groups (ES = 0.70-0.72, small-to-moderate effect). The results confirm limitations in the ability of the FMS to distinguish between groups for landing biomechanics."

Given the short- and long-term consequences of ACL injury, practitioners are interested in methods that reduce knee joint loads and subsequent ACL loading. An effective strategy to reduce ACL loading is modifying an athlete's movement mechanics to reduce knee joint loading. The purpose of this scoping review was to critically appraise and comprehensively synthesise the existing literature related to the effects of training interventions on COD biomechanics associated with increased knee joint loads and subsequent ACL loading, and identify gaps and recommend areas for future research. A review of the literature was conducted using Medline and Sport DISCUS databases. Inclusion criteria consisted of pre-post analysis of a COD task, a minimum 4-week training intervention, and assessments of biomechanical characteristics associated with increased ACL loading. Of the 1,027 articles identified, 22 were included in the scoping review. Based on current literature, balance training and COD technique modification are the most effective training modalities for reducing knee joint loading (small to moderate effect sizes). One study reported dynamic core stability training was effective in reducing knee joint loads, but further research is needed to definitively confirm the efficacy of this method. Perturbation-enhanced plyometric training, the F-MARC 11 + soccer specific warm-up, Oslo Neuromuscular warm-up, and resistance training are ineffective training modalities to reduce COD knee joint loads. Conflicting findings have been observed for the Core-Pac and mixed training programme. Consequently, practitioners should consider incorporating balance and COD technique modification drills into their athletes' training programmes to reduce potentially hazardous knee joint loads when changing direction. However, training intervention studies can be improved by investigating larger sample sizes (> 20), including a control group, acknowledging measurement error when interpreting their findings, and considering performance implications, to confirm the effectiveness of training interventions and improve adherence."

A lot of time and resources have been dedicated to cartilage regeneration research. Current understanding suggests that multi-disciplinary approach including biologic, genetic and mechanical stimulations may be needed for cell-based cartilage regeneration. This review summarizes contents of a workshop sponsored by International Combined Orthopedic Societies during the 2019 annual meeting of the Orthopaedic Research Society held in Austin, Texas. Three approaches for cell-based cartilage regeneration were introduced, including cellular basis of chondrogenesis, gene-enhanced cartilage regeneration, and physical modulation to divert stem cells to chondrogenic cell fate. While the complicated nature of cartilage regeneration has not allowed us to achieve successful regeneration of hyaline articular cartilage so far, the utilization of multi-disciplinary approaches in various fields of biomedical engineering will provide means to achieve this goal faster.

There is clinical evidence suggesting that the peroneal nerve is at greater risk for injury compared to the tibial nerve following total hip arthroplasty and hip trauma. We examined the two nerves from fresh human cadavers with or without controlled stretch. The mechanical properties, stiffness and strain were compared with light microscopic preparations in longitudinal sections stained by the trichrome method for collagen and showing the effects of structural deformation. The tibial nerve had an average failure load 1.7X that for the peroneal nerve (p=0.0001). Although the corresponding average stiffness showed a trend towards being larger (4.39 vs. 3.81 N/mm), the difference was not significant (p=0.126). Histologically, the perineurium along with the underlying nerve fascicle was undulated in the control specimens and straightened out in the stretched specimens. Peroneal nerves went on to failure at lower loads and exhibited a wavy pattern on pathologic slides after failure, which shows that peroneal nerves fail mechanically before they can unfold. The tibial nerve has a biomechanical and histological advantage compared to the peroneal nerve during tensile testing, which could be the reason why it is less commonly damaged. We conclude that the perineurium is especially protective against deformation changes in human nerves relative to the respective nerve size and number of fascicles.

However, there are no structure or disease-modifying OA drugs (DMOADs). Introducing personalized healthcare to patients and health-care practitioners is a high priority for the management of arthritic and musculoskeletal diseases. However, there are no biomarker tools that can be used for patient stratification, disease management, and drug development. Biomarkers are capable of diagnosing and prognosing some arthritic and musculoskeletal diseases. Cartilage-based biomarkers have the potential to be used in this context to guide the precision treatment of OA. <b>Areas covered</b>: The aim of this review is to focus on the pre-clinical and clinical utility of the Coll2-1 and Coll2-1NO2 biomarkers as unique cartilage-based biomarkers that can guide the development of new treatments for OA. This expert report will begin with a background to collagens and their important biomechanical roles in the musculoskeletal system, but particularly cartilage, before exploring the data and scientific evidence to support the utility of Coll2-1 and Coll2-1NO2 as unique biomarkers. <b>Expert opinion</b>: This review summarises the authors' expert view on the pre-clinical and clinical utility of the Coll2-1 and Coll2-1NO2 biomarkers and their potential for use as drug development tools."
effect mechanical loading substrate elasticity osteogenic adipogenic differentiation mesenchymal stem cells,TISSUE/BIOMATERIAL,30.6% TISSUE/BIOMATERIAL; 21.9% CELLULAR/SUBCELLULAR; 18.8% COMPARATIVE,"Gungordu HI, Bao M, van Helvert S, Jansen JA, Leeuwenburgh SCG, Walboomers XF,",*Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine*,* [Effect of mechanical loading and substrate elasticity on the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31483956),Effect of mechanical loading and substrate elasticity on the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are highly sensitive to biomechanics of their extra-cellular environment. Generally, a higher elasticity of culture substrates can drive cells into the osteogenic lineage, whereas low substrate elasticity results in adipogenesis. Applied mechanical loading by cyclic strain is another major variable influencing cell fate. Yet, little is known about the simultaneous effect of both cues. Therefore, the present study investigated the relative importance of both cues on differentiation. MSCs were cultured in an osteogenic and also an adipogenic environment on soft PAAm (E= 23±0.3 kPa), stiff PAAm (111±2 kPa), and PDMS (E= 1,5±0.07 MPa); either unstrained or with 8% cyclic strain at 1 Hz. Without strain, the relative expression of the early osteogenic marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was significantly higher (78%) on PDMS than both PAAm. With 8% cyclic strain ALP expression increased for all groups in comparison to unstrained controls. The highest increase was observed for the soft PAAm by 36%. Moreover, relative Oil red O (ORO) expression -indicating adipogenesis- was the highest for unstrained soft PAAm. On the other hand, the percentage ORO positive cells significantly decreased by 57% and 69% for PAAm soft and stiff when strained. In conclusion, biomaterial elasticity and mechanical loading can act simultaneously on cell differentiation. Substrate elasticity is an important factor regulating the differentiation, but cyclic strain can drive MSCs towards the osteogenesis even on the softest substrate. As such, the osteogenic effect of mechanical loading can overrule the adipogenic effect of soft substrates, thereby acting as an inhibitor."

However, concentrations tested in most studies are often much higher than the ones potentially identified in the environment. Therefore, such toxicity limits the application of these studies to evaluate ecotoxicological risks posed by these nanopollutants. Thus, the aim of the current study is to evaluate the impacts of ZnO NPs (at environmentally relevant concentrations - 760 μg/L and 76,000 μg/L, for 72 h) on the behavioral responses of Oreochromis niloticus (Nile tilapia) exposed to it. Results did not evidence harmful effects of NPs on animals' locomotor abilities (evaluated through open-field and light-dark transition tests), or anxiety-predictive behavior. On the other hand, Zn bioaccumulation in the body tissues of the analyzed tilapias was correlated to changes in eating behavior (motivated by ration pellets), as well as to deficits in antipredatory defensive behavior (under individual and collective conditions). Tilapia exposed to ZnO NPs recorded lower avoidance, flight and territorialist behavior rates when they were individually confronted with potential predators (Salminus brasiliensis). However, collectively exposed animals were unable to recognize their predators, as well as to differentiate them from artificial baits (""false predators""). The present study is the first to report biological impacts resulting from the short exposure of fish-group representatives to ZnO NPs. Thus, we believe that it may be relevant to improve the knowledge about ecotoxicological risks posed by these pollutants."

Therefore, we developed a closed sonication decellularization system to prepare ideal bioscaffolds with minimal adverse effects on the ECM. The decellularization was achieved at 170 kHz of ultrasound frequency in 0.1% and 2% Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate (SDS) solution for 10 hours. The immersion treatment as control was performed to compare the decellularization efficiency with our system. Cell removal and ECM structure were determined by histological staining and biochemical assay. Biomechanical properties were investigated by the indentation testing to test the stiffness, a residual force and compression of bioscaffolds. Additionally, in vivo implantation was performed in rat to investigate host tissue response. Compared to native tissues, histological staining and biochemical assay confirm the absence of cellularity with preservation of ECM structure. Moreover, sonication treatment has not affected the stiffness [N/mm] and a residual force [N] of the aortic scaffolds except for compression [%] which 2% SDS significantly decreased compared to native tissues showing higher SDS has a detrimental effect on ECM structure. Finally, minimal inflammatory response was observed after 1 and 5 weeks of implantation. This study reported that the novelty of our developed closed sonication system to prepare ideal bioscaffolds for tissue engineering applications."
movement vip interneuron activation differentially modulate encoding mouse auditory cortex,VETERINARY/AGRICULTURAL,86.9% ORTHOPAEDICS/SURGERY; 4.1% VETERINARY/AGRICULTURAL; 2.3% BONE,"Bigelow J, Morrill RJ, Dekloe J, Hasenstaub AR,",*eNeuro*,* [Movement and VIP interneuron activation differentially modulate encoding in mouse auditory cortex.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481397),Movement and VIP interneuron activation differentially modulate encoding in mouse auditory cortex.,"Information processing in sensory cortex is highly sensitive to non-sensory variables such as anesthetic state, arousal, and task engagement. Recent work in mouse visual cortex (VCtx) suggests that evoked firing rates, stimulus-response mutual information, and encoding efficiency increase when animals are engaged in movement. A disinhibitory circuit appears central this change: inhibitory neurons expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are activated during movement, and disinhibit pyramidal cells by suppressing other inhibitory interneurons. Paradoxically, although movement activates a similar disinhibitory circuit in auditory cortex (ACtx), most ACtx studies report reduced spiking during movement. It is unclear whether the resulting changes in spike rates result in corresponding changes in stimulus-response mutual information. We examined ACtx responses evoked by tone cloud stimuli, in awake mice of both sexes, during spontaneous movement and still conditions. VIP+ cells were optogenetically activated on half of trials, permitting independent analysis of the consequences of movement and VIP activation, as well as their intersection. Movement decreased stimulus-related spike rates as well as mutual information and encoding efficiency. VIP interneuron activation tended to increase stimulus-evoked spike rates but not stimulus-response mutual information, thus reducing encoding efficiency. The intersection of movement and VIP activation was largely consistent with a linear combination of these main effects: VIP activation recovered movement-induced reduction in spike rates, but not information transfer.<b>Significance Statement</b> The ability of the brain to represent information about the sensory environment is heavily influenced by the behavioral state of the animal. In visual cortex, it is well known that locomotor activity enhances visual stimulus processing. By contrast, the present study found that sound processing in auditory cortex is degraded during locomotor activity. Whereas enhanced stimulus processing in visual cortex is thought to depend on VIP+ interneuron activation, optogenetic activation of VIP+ interneurons in auditory cortex failed to improve stimulus processing. These findings imply that circuitry activated during movement has opposite influences on stimulus processing in visual and auditory cortices. Such differences could reflect a resource allocation shift during movement favoring spatial perception in service of the animal's navigational needs."

MDMA induces a consistently faster onset of brain hyperthermia when compared to a delayed and moderate hyperthermia in the body, and the most harmful effects of MDMA are related to its modulation of neural functions. The primary focus of this study was to investigate the effects of minocycline, a centrally acting tetracycline derivative on MDMA-induced brain hyperthermia at high ambient temperature. However, we also simultaneously recorded body temperature, heart rate, and locomotor activity changes, allowing us to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the MDMA-induced hyperthermic response. We also investigated the effects of MDMA at normal ambient temperature to provide further evidence as to the importance of environmental factors on the intensity of MDMA's temperature effects. At normal ambient temperature, MDMA (10 mg/kg, i.p.) induced a significant brain and body hypothermia for the first 90 min following drug administration, and significantly increased heart rate and locomotor activity compared to saline controls. At high ambient temperature however, MDMA (10 mg/kg, i.p.) induced a robust and extended brain and body hyperthermia, as well as significantly increased heart rate and locomotor activity. A 3-day minocycline (50 mg/kg, i.p.) pre-treatment significantly attenuated MDMA-induced increases in brain temperature, body temperature, heart rate, and locomotor activity. Our findings indicate that minocycline is more effective in attenuating the exacerbated MDMA-induced hyperthermic response in the brain compared to the body at high ambient temperature."

In particular, in birds and mammals, ribs are present only in the thoracic region. The axial skeleton is derived from a series of somites. In the thoracic region of the axial skeleton, descendants of somites coherently penetrate into the somatic mesoderm to form ribs. In regions other than the thoracic, descendants of somites do not penetrate the somatic lateral plate mesoderm. We performed live-cell time-lapse imaging to investigate the difference in the migration of a somite cell after contact with the somatic lateral plate mesoderm obtained from different regions of anterior-posterior axis in vitro on cytophilic narrow paths. We found that a thoracic somite cell continues to migrate after contact with the thoracic somatic lateral plate mesoderm, whereas it ceases migration after contact with the lumbar somatic lateral plate mesoderm. This suggests that cell-cell interaction works as an important guidance cue that regulates migration of somite cells. We surmise that the thoracic somatic lateral plate mesoderm exhibits region-specific competence to allow penetration of somite cells, whereas the lumbosacral somatic lateral plate mesoderm repels somite cells by contact inhibition of locomotion. The differences in the behavior of the somatic lateral plate mesoderm toward somite cells may confirm the distinction between different regions of the axial skeleton."
