Because of the complex nature of how the upper limb moves, as well as due to its complex musculoskeletal arrangement, the biomechanics, in particular the mechanical loadings, of the clavicle are not fully understood. Given that bone remodeling can be influenced by bone stress, the histologic organization of Haversian bone offers a hypothesis of responses to force distributions experienced across a bone. Furthermore, circularly polarized light microscopy can be used to determine the orientation of collagen fibers, providing additional information on how bone matrix might organize to adapt to direction of external loads. We examined Haversian density and collagen fiber orientation, along with cross-sectional geometry, to test whether the clavicle midshaft shows unique adaptation to atypical load-bearing when compared with the sternal (medial) and acromial (lateral) shaft regions. Because fractures are most common at the midshaft, we predicted that the cortical bone structure would show both disparities in Haversian remodeling and nonrandomly oriented collagen fibers in the midshaft compared with the sternal and acromial regions. Human clavicles (n = 16) were sampled via thin-sections at the sternal, middle, and acromial ends of the shaft, and paired sample t-tests were employed to evaluate within-individual differences in microstructural or geometric properties. We found that Haversian remodeling is slightly but significantly reduced in the middle of the bone. Analysis of collagen fiber orientation indicated nonrandom fiber orientations that are overbuilt for tensile loads or torsion but are poorly optimized for compressive loads throughout the clavicle. Geometric properties of percent bone area, polar second moment of area, and shape (I<sub>max</sub> /I<sub>min</sub> ) confirmed the conclusions drawn by existing research on clavicle macrostructure. Our results highlight that mediolateral shape changes might be accompanied by slight changes in Haversian density, but bone matrix organization is predominantly adapted to resisting tensile strains or torsion throughout and may be a major factor in the risk of fracture when experiencing atypical compression.",

A considerable number of such formulae can be found in the biomechanics' literature covering both cortical and cancellous constituents. For determining the first and second modal frequencies (in both cranial-caudal and medial-lateral planes) of bovine tibia bone, this work assembled and numerically tested 22 isotropic and 21 orthotropic stiffness-density formulae combinations (cases). To accurately reproduce bone geometry, anatomical 3D models were generated from computed tomography (CT) scans. By matching the bone's digital mass to its actual mass, cortical and cancellous constituents were faithfully segmented by utilizing suitable values of three variables: (1) critical cutoff Hounsfield unit (HU) values, (2) cutoff density value, and (3) utilized number of sub-materials. Consequently, a balanced distribution of finite elements was generated with stiffness values congruent with their cancellous or cortical demarcations. Of the considered 22 isotropic formulae cases and 21 orthotropic (reduced to transversely isotropic) cases, only few yielded accurate frequency estimates. For verifying the accuracy of the solutions emanating from the various formulae, experimental vibration tests of corresponding mode frequencies and shapes (ProSig©) were conducted. When compared with the measured experimental frequency values, the most accurate isotropic formulae yielded numerical estimates of + 0.95% and + 10.65% for the first and second cranial-caudal (C-C) frequencies, respectively. The formulae yielding most accurate estimates also proved successful in estimating frequencies of a second tibia bone yielding numerical estimates within + 4.75% and + 1.88% of the said mode frequencies. For the transversely isotropic material assignment, the closest case scenario computed numerical estimates with a percentage difference of + 2.05% and + 9.36% for the first and second cranial-caudal (C-C) frequencies, respectively.

However, there remain risks of failure which may have dramatic consequences. The success of an implant depends on its stability, which is determined by the biomechanical properties of the bone-implant interface (BII). The aim of this review article is to provide more insight on the current state of the art concerning the evolution of the biomechanical properties of the BII as a function of the implant's environment. The main characteristics of the BII and the determinants of implant stability are first introduced. Then, the different mechanical methods that have been employed to derive the macroscopic properties of the BII will be described. The experimental multi-modality approaches used to determine the microscopic biomechanical properties of periprosthetic newly formed bone tissue are also reviewed. Eventually, the influence of the implant's properties, in terms of both surface properties and biomaterials, is investigated. A better understanding of the phenomena occurring at the BII will lead to (i) medical devices that help surgeons to determine an implant's stability and (ii) an improvement in the quality of implants.",BONE

Therefore, this study aims to use a feed-forward neural network to predict hip, knee and ankle joint moments as well as the ground reaction force from kinematic data during the execution and depart contact of a maximum effort 90° cutting manoeuvre. A total number of 525 cutting manoeuvres performed by 55 athletes were used to train and test neural networks. Either marker trajectories or joint angles were used as input data. The correlation coefficient between the measured and predicted data indicated strong correlations. By using joint angles as the input parameters, slightly but not significantly higher accuracy was found in joint moments predictions. The prediction of the ground reaction force showed significantly higher accuracy when using marker trajectories. Hence, the proposed feed-forward neural network method can be used to predict motion kinetics during a fast change of direction. This may allow for the simplification of cutting manoeuvres experimental set-ups for and through the use of inertial sensors.

Besides hydroxyapatite minerals and collagen proteins, non-collagenous proteins such as osteopontin are also a very important component in bone. The aim of this paper is to study the role of osteopontin on the mechanical strength of biological composites. The MD simulations were performed to investigate the failure energy of osteopontin in two different directions, i.e. the direction normal to surface (thickness direction) and the direction tangential to surface (interface direction). The FE simulations were then performed to investigate the effects of failure energy in different directions on biological composites. The results show that the failure energy of osteopontin is higher in the interface direction. Significant improvement in the mechanical behaviour of biological composites is also found with the increased failure energy in the interface direction. Contrarily, although lower failure energy of osteopontin is observed in the thickness direction, but it is also found that the mechanical behaviour of biological composites does not greatly affected by the failure energy in the thickness direction. The numerical investigation provides important insights into how the osteopontin affects the mechanical behaviour of biological composites.",BONE

Here, we examined the early origins of the neural processing of action sounds to investigate whether and how infants rely on auditory information to understand their close social environment. Sensorimotor activity, as indexed by μ rhythm suppression, was measured using electroencephalography in 14-month-old infants who listened to hand- and foot-produced action sounds (i.e., footsteps and clapping) and to mechanical sounds (i.e., blender). Footstep sounds elicited activation at midline electrodes over the foot area (Cz), and not in correspondence of lateralized clusters over the hand areas (C3 and C4). Greater activation in response to clapping compared to blender and footstep sounds was recorded at electrodes in the left central cluster, over the hand sensorimotor cortex (i.e., C3), but extended to some extent over the midline electrode cluster. Furthermore, our results underscore the role of natural locomotor experience in shaping sensorimotor activation, since infants who gained more walking experience exhibited stronger sensorimotor activation for footstep sounds over left central electrodes. Taken together, current results provide the first evidence that action sounds produced by another person are capable to elicit sensorimotor activation during infancy.",BONE

Nucleus pulposus (NP) replacements are a promising strategy for restoring disc biomechanics and height loss. Cellulose-based hydrogel systems offer potential for NP replacement since they are stable, non-toxic, may be tuned to match NP material properties, and are conducive to cell or drug delivery. A crosslinked, carboxymethylcellulose-methylcellulose dual-polymer hydrogel was recently formulated as an injectable NP replacement that gelled in situ and restored disc height and compressive biomechanical properties. The objective of this study was to investigate the translational potential of this hydrogel system by examining the long-term structural stability in vitro, the herniation risk and fatigue bending endurance in a bovine motion segment model, and the in vivo biocompatibility in a rat subcutaneous pouch model. Results showed that the hydrogels maintained their structural integrity over a 12-week period. AF injury significantly increased herniation risk and reduced fatigue bending endurance in bovine motion segments. Samples repaired with cellulosic hydrogels demonstrated restored height and exhibited herniation risk and fatigue endurance comparable to samples that underwent the current standard treatment of nucleotomy. Lastly, injected hydrogels elicited a minimal foreign body response as determined by analysis of fibrous capsule development and macrophage presence over 12 weeks. Overall, this injectable cellulosic hydrogel system is a promising candidate as an NP substitute. Further assessment and optimization of this cellulosic hydrogel system in an in vivo intradiscal injury model may lead to an improved clinical solution for disc degeneration and herniation.",TISSUE/BIOMATERIAL

The crude A. bidentata polysaccharide (AB70) was prepared by hot water extraction- ethanol precipitation method and a homogeneous fructan (ABW70-1) was purified from AB70 by ion-exchange and gel filtration column chromatography. Structural analysis indicated that ABW70-1 was composed of (2 → 1)-linked-β-d-fructofuranosyl (Fruf), (2 → 6)-linked-β-d-Fruf and (2 → 1,6)-linked-β-d-Fruf residues, and terminated with fructose and glucose residue. AB70 treatment for 13 weeks has shown a therapeutic effect on ovariectomized rats by restoring bone mineral content and biomechanical properties of the femur. Moreover, such osteoprotective effects of AB70 on bone mass were accompanied by improving trabecular bone microarchitecture and decreasing serum levels of bone turnover biomarkers. Furthermore, ABW70-1 stimulated the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells by promoting cell proliferation, ALP activity, mineral nodules formation and the gene expression of Osx, Ocn and Bsp.

However, peristaltic turning has primarily been studied empirically. Surface-dependent slip, which results in frictional forces that deform the body segments, makes accurate models challenging and limited to a specific robot and environment. Here, instead of modeling <i>specific</i> surfaces and segments, we take a geometric approach to analyzing the constraints that result from elimination of slip for the <i>general</i> case of peristaltic locomotion. Thus, our abstract two-dimensional model applies to many different mechanical designs (e.g., fluidic actuation, origami, woven mesh). Specifically, we show how turning is limited by segment range of motion, which means that more than one wave will be required to completely reorient the body in an environment where slip is not possible. As a result, to eliminate slip, segments must undergo nonperiodic shape changes. By representing segments as isosceles trapezoids with reasonable ranges of motion, we can determine control waves that in simulation do not require slip. These waves follow from an initial ""reach"" (i.e., kinematic movement range) of the second segment. A strategy for choosing the second segment reach is proposed based on evaluating long-term turn stability. To demonstrate the value of the approach, we applied the nonperiodic waveform (NPW) to our earthworm-inspired soft robot, Compliant Modular Mesh Worm with Steering (CMMWorm-S). With the NPW, the robot slips less when compared with a naive periodic waveform, where each segment of the robot has the same kinematic reach of each wave, as indicated by the difference between predicted and actual body position over multiple waves. Using an NPW for turning, we observe a decrease in prediction error compared with a naive periodic waveform by 66%. Thus, while our model ignores many factors (inertial dynamics, radial deformation, surface forces), the resulting turn strategies can improve kinematic motion prediction for planning. The theoretical constraints on NPWs that eliminate slip during turning will help robot designers make application-specific design choices about body stiffness, frictional properties, body length, and degrees of freedom.",TISSUE/BIOMATERIAL

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart disease. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a treatment approach for CAVD where a stent with mounted bioprosthetic valve is deployed on the stenotic valve. Performing TAVR in calcified BAV patients may be associated with post-procedural complications due to the BAV asymmetrical structure. This study aims to develop refined computational models simulating the deployments of Evolut R and PRO TAVR devices in a representative calcified BAV. The paravalvular leakage (PVL) was also calculated by computational fluid dynamics simulations. Computed tomography scan of severely stenotic BAV patient was acquired. The 3D calcium deposits were generated and embedded inside a parametric model of the BAV. Deployments of the Evolut R and PRO inside the calcified BAV were simulated in five bioprosthesis leaflet orientations. The hypothesis of asymmetric and elliptic stent deployment was confirmed. Positioning the bioprosthesis commissures aligned with the native commissures yielded the lowest PVL (15.7 vs. 29.5 mL/beat). The Evolut PRO reduced the PVL in half compared with the Evolut R (15.7 vs. 28.7 mL/beat). The proposed biomechanical computational model could optimize future TAVR treatment in BAV patients.

Additionally, the temporal transcriptional profile associated with the early biological processes during osseointegration was determined. BCP and hydroxyapatite (HA) bone substitutes with simultaneous implant placement were grafted into mandibular defects created in mini-swine. Radiographic, histological, and biochemical analyses were applied for evaluation of osseointegration effects at 4 months after the grafting procedure. Bone formation around the implant was assessed by the bone area percentage (BA%) and the bone-implant-contact percentage (BIC%). The biomechanical evaluation was performed by the implant pullout test and the removal torque test. Microarray technology was utilized for gene expression comparison analysis at day 14 postoperatively. Radiographic and histological observation indicated enhanced bone formation in the BCP group compared to the HA group. Histomorphometric analyses of BA% and BIC% as well as biochemical analyses of the maximal pull-out force and the ultimate shear strength were all significantly greater in the BCP group (p < 0.05). Transcriptional analysis at an early stage of osseointegration revealed that genes belonging to biological processes associated with cell proliferation, development, osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis as well as the osteogenesis-related TGF-β/BMP and WNT signaling pathways were upregulated in the BCP group. In conclusion, the reconstruction of mandibular defects using BCP with simultaneous implant placement resulted in superior osseointegration effects.

Despite this, elbow replacement has remained popular. Surgical technique for TEA destabilizes the elbow by removing the medial and lateral collateral ligaments and, frequently, the radiocapitellar articulation. Current semiconstrained implants aim to allow for physiological varus and valgus motion by employing a sloppy hinge; however, over time, these designs fail owing to nonanatomic force transmission. Nonanatomic force transmission results from ligament release, force transmission primarily to the humeral and ulnar shafts, and radial head resection. These altered biomechanics may be the source of complications seen in semiconstrained arthroplasty. These complications perpetuate the cycle of failure and ultimately have poor salvage options.",

This approach, termed Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI), has the potential to elucidate the neural correlates of perceptual and cognitive processes during real-life activities, such as locomotion. However, as of yet, no one has assessed the long-term stability of event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded under these conditions. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to evaluate the test-retest reliability of cognitive ERPs recorded while walking. High-density EEG was acquired from 12 young adults on two occasions, separated by an average of 2.3years, as they performed a Go/No-Go response inhibition paradigm. During each testing session, participants performed the task while walking on a treadmill and seated. Using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) as a measure of agreement, we focused on two well-established neurophysiological correlates of cognitive control, the N2 and P3 ERPs. Following ICA-based artifact rejection, the earlier N2 yielded good to excellent levels of reliability for both amplitude and latency, while measurements for the later P3 component were generally less robust but still indicative of adequate to good levels of stability. Interestingly, the N2 was more consistent between walking sessions, compared to sitting, for both hits and correct rejection trials. In contrast, the P3 waveform tended to have a higher degree of consistency during sitting conditions. Overall, these results suggest that the electro-cortical signals obtained during active walking are representative of stable indices of neurophysiological function.",

Peripheral arterial stenosis may indicate possible serious vascular disorders related to more vital organs. If peripheral arterial stenosis can be discerned at an early stage, it can serve as a warning sign to take precautions, such as using more invasive diagnostic techniques or adopting a healthier life style. In this study, peripheral regions, such as the thigh, upper arm, and neck are modelled considering stenosis of their major arteries. Stenosis generates a fluctuating pressure field on the arterial wall, which leads to vibration on the skin's surface. This stenosis-induced pressure field is modelled as a harmonic load and applied to the inner surface of the arterial structure. The vibration response on bare skin is computationally determined using the superposition of modal responses. Realistic geometries and hyperelastic material properties are used in modelling the layers of skin, fat, muscle, and bones. The results indicate that stenosis severities higher than 70% lead to a considerable increase in vibration-response amplitudes, especially at frequencies greater than 250 Hz. The detailed analysis of skin responses provides useful information to detect the stenosis location, where the sum of the vibration amplitudes attains its maximum value around the stenosis.",

The outcome of SCI is contributed to by neuroinflammation, which may be a target for improved recovery and quality of life after injury. Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1/growth differentiation factor 15 (MIC-1/GDF15) has been identified as a potential novel therapy for central nervous system (CNS) injury because it is an immune regulatory cytokine with neurotrophic properties. Here we used MIC-1/GDF15 knockout (KO) and overexpressing/transgenic (Tg) and wild type (WT) animals to explore its putative therapeutic benefits in a mouse model of contusive SCI. MIC-1/GDF15 Tg mice had superior locomotor recovery and reduced secondary tissue loss at 28 days compared with their KO and WT counterparts. Overexpression of MIC-1/GDF15 coincided with increased expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)/C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL2) at the lesion site (28 days post-SCI) and enhanced recruitment of inflammatory cells to the injured spinal cord. This inflammatory cellular infiltrate included an increased frequency of macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) that mostly preceded recruitment of cluster of differentiation (CD)4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Collectively, our findings suggest hat MIC-1/GDF15 is associated with beneficial changes in the clinical course of SCI that are characterized by altered post-injury inflammation and improved functional outcome. Further investigation of MIC-1/GDF15 as a novel therapeutic target for traumatic SCI appears warranted.",

However, the functional relevance of immunoproteasomes in the healthy brain and especially their impact on normal brain function including processes of learning and memory has not been investigated so far. In the present study, we analyzed the phenotypic effects of an impaired immunoproteasome formation using a β5i/LMP7-deficient mouse model in different behavioral paradigms focusing on locomotor activity, exploratory behavior, innate anxiety, startle response, prepulse inhibition, as well as fear and safety conditioning. Overall, our results demonstrate no strong effects of constitutive β5i/LMP7-deficiency on gross locomotor abilities and anxiety-related behavior in general. However, β5i/LMP7-deficient mice expressed more anxiety after mild stress and increased cued fear after fear conditioning. These findings indicate that the basal proper formation of immunoproteasomes and/or at least the expression of β5i/LMP7 in healthy mice seem to be involved in the regulation of anxiety and cued fear levels.",

A profuse literature on transgenic mouse lines points out the deleterious effects of Cre expression in various cell types and tissues, presumably by acting on illegitimate loxP-like sites present in the genome. However, most studies reporting the consequences of Cre-lox gene invalidation often omit adequate controls to exclude the potential toxic effects of Cre, compromising the interpretation of data. In this study, we report the anatomical, neurochemical, and behavioral consequences in mice of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated Cre expression in the dopaminergic nuclei substantia nigra, at commonly used viral titers (3 × 10<sup>9</sup> genome copies/0.3 μL or 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> genome copies/0.6 μL). We found that injecting AAV-eGFP-Cre into the SN engendered drastic and reproducible modifications of behavior, with increased basal locomotor activity as well as impaired locomotor response to cocaine compared to AAV-eGFP-injected controls. Cre expression in the SN induced a massive decrease in neuronal populations of both pars compacta and pars reticulata and dopamine depletion in the nigrostriatal pathway. This anatomical injury was associated with typical features of programmed cell death, including an increase in DNA break markers, evidence of apoptosis, and disrupted macroautophagy. These observations underscore the need for careful control of Cre toxicity in the brain and the reassessment of previous studies. In addition, our findings suggest that Cre-mediated ablation may constitute an efficient tool to explore the function of specific cell populations and areas in the brain, and the impact of neurodegeneration in these populations.",

Similarities in behavioral and cellular functional changes suggest a common regulator between aging and AD that remains undetermined. Our genetics and behavioral approaches revealed the regulatory role of Akt in both aging and AD pathogenesis. In this study, we found that the activity of Akt is upregulated during aging through epidermal growth factor receptor activation by using the fruit fly as an in vivo model. Downregulation of Akt in neurons improved cell survival, locomotor activity, and starvation challenge in both aged and Aβ42-expressing flies. Interestingly, increased cAMP levels attenuated both Akt activation-induced early death and Aβ42-induced learning deficit in flies. At the molecular level, overexpression of Akt promoted Notch cleavage, suggesting that Akt is an endogenous activity regulator of γ-secretase. Taken together, this study revealed that Akt is involved in the aging process and Aβ toxicity, and manipulating Akt can restore both neuronal functions and improve behavioral activity during the processes of aging and AD pathogenesis.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate if apoptosis in the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC) contributes to the depressive-/anxiogenic-like behavioral phenotype induced by dexamethasone (DEX) subchronic exposure. In the present study, adult male Swiss mice were exposed to DEX (2 mg/kg), or to saline solution (10 ml/kg), by the intraperitoneal route for 21 days. At the 22<sup>nd</sup> day, the mice performed anxiety- and depressive-like behavior tests. Subsequently, the samples of PFC were designated to the Western blot and Fluoro-Jade C staining analyses. The mice exposed to DEX exhibited a depressive-/anxiogenic-like phenotype, normal locomotor activity profile and a reduction in the weight of adrenal glands (% body weight). Reduced levels of GC receptors and an increase in the FJC-positive cells were found in the PFCs of mice subcronically exposed to DEX. The levels of pro-apoptotic protein cleaved caspase-3 and the ratios of PARP cleaved/total and Bax/Bcl-2 were increased in the PFCs of mice after subchronic exposure to DEX. These findings demonstrate that the pro-apoptotic cell signaling in the PFC contributed to the depressive-/anxiogenic-like phenotype in mice subchronically exposed to DEX.",

Details about the manner in which cell wall polymers at the periclinal wall regulate the morphogenetic process in epidermal pavement cells and mechanistic information about the initial steps leading to the characteristic undulations in the cell borders are elusive. Here, we used genetics and recently developed cell mechanical and imaging methods to study the impact of the spatio-temporal dynamics of cellulose and homogalacturonan pectin distribution during lobe formation in the epidermal pavement cells of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cotyledons. We show that non-uniform distribution of cellulose microfibrils and demethylated pectin coincides with spatial differences in cell wall stiffness but may intervene at different developmental stages. We also show that lobe period can be reduced when demethyl-esterification of pectins increases under conditions of reduced cellulose crystallinity. Our data suggest that lobe initiation involves a modulation of cell wall stiffness through local enrichment in demethylated pectin, whereas subsequent increase in lobe amplitude is mediated by the stress-induced deposition of aligned cellulose microfibrils. Our results reveal a key role of non-cellulosic polymers in the biomechanical regulation of cell morphogenesis.",

Motion and muscle activation of the trunk and lower extremity were measured while 20 recreationally active individuals performed 2 sets of 10 repetitions of each exercise. Equivalent loads were used for each exercise. Peak, average, and integrated muscle activity, low back moment, and ROM between the trunk and pelvis and the thigh and trunk were calculated. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p = 0.05) revealed significantly greater integrated activity of the biceps femoris and gluteus maximus during the HE exercise. The RHE exercise generated greater peak (+129%), integrated (+63%), and mean (+78%) low back moment as compared to the HE exercise. The RHE resulted in a significantly greater thigh to trunk ROM, 76.6 compared with 64.7. However, the RHE used less lumbar flexion, 20.4 compared with 31.1 for the HE. The RHE movement profile is preferable because it provides greater hip ROM with less angular stress and equivalent erector spinae activity.",

There are currently no approved treatments for RTT. The expression of K<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter 2 (KCC2), a neuron-specific protein, has been found to be reduced in human RTT neurons and in RTT mouse models, suggesting that KCC2 might play a role in the pathophysiology of RTT. To develop neuron-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assays to identify chemical compounds that enhance the expression of the <i>KCC2</i> gene, we report the generation of a robust high-throughput drug screening platform that allows for the rapid assessment of <i>KCC2</i> gene expression in genome-edited human reporter neurons. From an unbiased screen of more than 900 small-molecule chemicals, we have identified a group of compounds that enhance KCC2 expression termed KCC2 expression-enhancing compounds (KEECs).

It glides on substrates propelled by beating cilia on its lower surface and periodically pauses to feed on underlying microorganisms, which it digests externally. Here a combination of advanced electron and light microscopic techniques are used to take a closer look at its secretory cell types and their roles in locomotion and feeding. We identify digestive enzymes in lipophils, a cell type implicated in external digestion and distributed uniformly throughout the ventral epithelium except for a narrow zone near its edge. We find three morphologically distinct types of gland cell. The most prevalent contains and secretes mucus, which is shown to be involved in adhesion and gliding.

Nowadays, force volume (FV) and peakforce quantitative nanomechanical (QNM) are two distinct modes of AFM used in biomechanical research. However, numerous studies have revealed an extremely confusing phenomenon that FV mode has a significant difference with QNM in determining the mechanical properties of the same samples. In this article, for the case of human benign prostatic hyperplasia cells (BPH) and two cancerous prostate cells with different grades of malignancy (PC3 and DU145), the differences were compared between FV and QNM modes in detecting mechanical properties. The results show measured Young's modulus of the same cells in FV mode was much lower than that obtained by QNM mode. Combining experimental results with working principles of two modes, it is indicated that surface adhesion is highly suspected to be a critical factor resulting in the measurement difference between two modes. To further confirm this conjecture, various weight ratios of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) were assessed by two modes, respectively. The results show that the difference of Young's modulus measured by two modes increases with the surface adhesion of PDMS, confirming that adhesion is one of the significant elements that lead to the measurement difference between FV and QNM modes.",

Although we have foundational knowledge about squamate skin morphology, we still know remarkably little about how intraspecific variation in skin surface structure translates to functional variation. This gap in our understanding can be in part traced back to: (i) our lack of knowledge on how body size determines skin surface structure; and (ii) the lack of means to perform high-throughput and detailed analysis of the three-dimensional (3D) anatomy of reptilian skin surfaces in a non-destructive manner. To fill this gap, we explored the possibilities of a new imaging technique, termed gel-based stereo-profilometry, to visualize and quantify the 3D topography of reptilian skin surface structure. Using this novel approach, we investigated intra-specific and intra-individual variation in the skin surface morphology of a focal lizard species, Anolis cristatellus. We assessed how various characteristics of surface topography (roughness, skew and kurtosis) and scale morphology (area, height, width and shape) scale with body size across different body regions. Based on an ontogenetic series of A. cristatellus males, we show that skin roughness increases with body size. Skin patches on the ventral body region of lizards were rougher than on the dorsum, but this was a consequence of ventral scales being larger than dorsal scales. Dorsal surface skew and kurtosis varied with body size, but surfaces on the ventral skin showed no such relationship. Scale size scaled isometrically with body size, and while ventral scales differed in shape from dorsal scales, scale shape did not change with ontogeny. Overall, this study demonstrates that gel-based stereo-profilometry is a promising method to rapidly assess the 3D surface structure of reptilian skin at the microscopic level. Additionally, our findings of the explanatory power of body size on skin surface diversity provide a foundation for future studies to disentangle the relationships among morphological, functional and ecological diversity in squamate reptile skin surfaces.",

Alterations in serotonergic signaling are involved in the genesis of ASD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been reported to reduce repetitive behaviors and rescue social deficits in ASD mouse models and patients. In the present study, we examined the potential of citalopram (a representative selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) on sociability and repetitive behaviors in the BTBR T<sup>+</sup>Itpr3<sup>tf</sup>/J (BTBR) mouse model of ASD. We found that the deficits of sociability in the BTBR mice were reversed by a 20 mg/kg dose of citalopram treatment without any adverse effects on locomotor activity or anxiety level. In addition, both high (20 mg/kg) and low (10 mg/kg) doses decreased the repetitive behavior of marble burying but did not affect self-grooming behavior. Furthermore, both doses were shown to have antidepressant-like activity in both the B6 and the BTBR mice in the tail suspension test. Taken together, these findings further demonstrate that citalopram can alleviate behavioral abnormalities in the BTBR autism model and lend support to the hypothesis that SSRIs may be potential therapeutic drugs for the treatment of behavioral dysfunctions in ASD.",

Here, using non-invasive cutometry and ballistometry, we explore the consequences of ageing on the biomechanical function of skin in otherwise healthy White Northern European volunteers. Intrinsic skin ageing caused biomechanical decline; skin loses both resilience (P < 0.01) and elasticity (P < 0.001), which is characterised histologically by modest effacement of rete ridges (P < 0.05) and disorganisation of papillary dermal elastic fibres. At photoexposed sites, biomechanical testing identified significant loss of biomechanical function-particularly in the aged cohort. Photoaged forearm displayed severe loss of resilience (P < 0.001) and elasticity (P < 0.001); furthermore with repetitive testing, fatigue (P < 0.001), hysteresis (P < 0.001) and viscous ""creep"" (P < 0.001) were exacerbated. Histologically, both young and aged forearm displayed flattening of rete ridges and disruption to the arrangement of elastic fibres. We conclude that maintenance of skin architecture is inherently associated with optimal biomechanical properties. Modest perturbations to skin architecture-as exemplified by intrinsic ageing-result in moderate functional decline. Chronic sun exposure causes fundamental changes to the clinical and histological appearance of skin, and these are reflected by an extreme alteration in biomechanical function.",

The aim of this study was to investigate how experimentally observed mechanobiological adaptation of rat Achilles tendons translate to changes in constitutive mechanical properties and biomechanical behavior. In addition, we assessed the ability of the model to simulate tendon creep and stress-relaxation. A three dimensional finite element framework of rat Achilles tendon was implemented with a fibre-reinforced poro-visco-hyper-elastic constitutive model. Stress-relaxation and creep data from Achilles tendons of Sprague Dawley rats that had been subjected to both daily loading and a period of reduced loading were used to determine the constitutive properties of the tendons. Our results showed that the constitutive model captures creep and stress-relaxation data from rat Achilles tendons for both loaded and unloaded tendons with good accuracy (normalized root mean square error between model and experimental data were 0.010-0.027). Only when the model parameters were fitted to data from both mechanical tests simultaneously, were we able to also capture similar increase in elastic energy (increased stiffness) and decreased viscoelasticity in response to unloading, as was reported experimentally. Our study is the first to show that experimentally observed mechanobiological changes in tendon biomechanics, such as stiffness and viscoelasticity, can be designated to mechanical quantities in a constitutive model. Further investigation in this direction has potential to discriminate tissue components responsible for specific biomechanical response, and enable targeted treatment strategies for tendon health.",

At present, few studies evaluated the combined impact of these stressors on fish physiology and behavior. Here, we tested the effect of the combination of hypoxia and petrogenic hydrocarbons on the anti-predator locomotor performance of fish. Specifically, two groups of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were exposed to clean water (Ctrl) or oil-contaminated water (Oil). Subsequently, fish of both groups were placed in normoxic (norx) or hypoxic (hyp) experimental tanks (i.e. four groups of fish were formed: Ctrl norx, Ctrl hyp, Oil norx, Oil hyp). In these tanks, escape response was elicited by a mechano-acoustic stimulus and recorded with a high speed camera. Several variables were analyzed: escape response duration, responsiveness (percentage of fish responding to the stimulation), latency (time taken by the fish to initiate a response), directionality (defined as away or toward the stimulus), distance-time variables (such as speed and acceleration), maneuverability variables (such as turning rate), escape trajectory (angle of flight) and distancing of the fish from the stimulus. Results revealed (i) effects of stressors (Ctrl hyp, Oil norx and Oil hyp) on the directionality; (ii) effects of Oil norx and Oil hyp on maneuverability and (iii) effects of Oil hyp on distancing. These results suggest that individual stressors could alter the escape response of fish and that their combination could strengthen these effects. Such an impact could decrease the probability of prey escape success. By investigating the effects of hydrocarbons (and the interaction with hypoxia) on the anti-predator behavior of fish, this work increases our understanding of the biological impact of oil spill. Additionally, the results of this study are of interest for oil spill impact evaluation and also for developing new ecotoxicological tools of ecological significance.",

Since the mid-2000s, we have shown that intrasurgical delivery of stimulation in the pontine tegmentum affects the firing activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), but its effect on STN oscillatory rhythms has not been studied. Neuronal oscillations detected by local field potential (LFPs) have great importance, since they express complex movement-related behavior such as locomotion. Therefore, we examined the effect of three PPNa-DBS stimulation protocols (at 10, 25 and 80 Hz) on the STN oscillatory activity of PD patients. We focused on the anti-kinetic beta (β, 15-30 Hz), the pro-kinetic gamma (γ, 60-90 Hz) and ""gait-related"" alpha (α, 7-12 Hz) bands. We hypothesized that modulation of STN oscillations might have clinical relevance in the PPNa-mediated effects. PPNa stimulation at 25 and 80 Hz decreased the power of the STN β band by 33.94 and 40.22%, respectively. PPNa-DBS did not affect the other two bands with a tendency to suppress α power, while γ oscillation increased. Our results suggest that the anti-kinetic β band is the oscillation most sensitive to PPNa-DBS despite the negligible clinical efficacy on bradykinesia. However, how these changes interact reciprocally with the cortex or are counterbalanced by lower brainstem/spinal pathways remain to be elucidated. Our observation might turn out to be helpful in new protocols designed with adaptive DBS supporting the addition of PPN implantation in PD patients experiencing declining efficacy of STN-DBS.",

As such, these models may lack the face validity required to adequately model pathophysiological features of PTSD such as CNS grey matter loss and neuroinflammation. Here we aimed to investigate in a mouse model of PTSD whether contextual fear conditioning associated with a relatively high intensity footshock exposure induces loss of neuronal dendritic spines in various corticolimbic brain regions, as their regression may help explain grey matter reductions in PTSD patients. Further, we aimed to observe whether these changes were accompanied by alterations in microglial cell number and morphology, and increased expression of complement factors implicated in the mediation of microglial cell-mediated engulfment of dendritic spines. Adult male C57Bl6J mice were exposed to a single electric footshock and subsequently underwent phenotyping of various PTSD-relevant behaviours in the short (day 2-4) and longer-term (day 29-31). 32 days post-exposure the brains of these animals were subjected to Golgi staining of dendritic spines, microglial cell Iba-1 immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent staining of the complement factors C1q and C4. Shock exposure promoted a lasting contextual fear response, decreased locomotor activity, exaggerated acoustic startle responses indicative of hyperarousal, and a short-term facilitation of sensorimotor gating function. The shock triggered loss of dendritic spines on pyramidal neurons was accompanied by increased microglial cell number and complexity in the medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus, but not in the amygdala. Shock also increased expression of C1q in the pyramidal layer of the CA1 region of the hippocampus but not in other brain regions. The present study further elaborates on the face and construct validity of a mouse model of PTSD and provides a good foundation to explore potential molecular interactions between microglia and dendritic spines.",

Similarly, female rats can show more incentive motivation for cocaine than male rats do. Most preclinical studies on this issue have used self-administration procedures that provide continuous cocaine access during each session (""long-access"" or LgA and ""short-access""). However, intermittent access (IntA) cocaine self-administration better models the intermittency of human cocaine use. Here, we compared cocaine use in female and male rats that received ten, daily 6-hour LgA or IntA sessions. Cocaine intake was greatest under LgA, and female LgA rats escalated their intake. Only IntA rats (both sexes) developed locomotor sensitization to self-administered cocaine, and sensitization was greatest in females. Five and 25 days after the last self-administration session, we quantified responding for cocaine (0.083-0.75 mg/kg/infusion) under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule, a measure of motivation for drug. Across conditions, females earned more cocaine infusions than males under the PR schedule. Across sexes, IntA rats earned more infusions than LgA rats, even though IntA rats had previously taken much less cocaine. Cumulative cocaine intake significantly predicted responding for cocaine under the PR schedule in male LgA rats only. In IntA rats, the extent of locomotor sensitization significantly predicted responding under the PR schedule. Thus, LgA might be appropriate to study sex differences in cocaine intake, whereas IntA might be best suited to study sex differences in sensitization-related neuroadaptations involved in cocaine addiction. This has implications for modelling distinct features of cocaine addiction in preclinical studies.",

Nociceptive sensory input is capable of altering motor output at the spinal level, and nociceptive neurons are sensitized after SCI. Here we tested the hypotheses that stretch-induced locomotor deficits are dependent on nociceptive afferents by depleting TRPV1+ sensory afferents using capsaicin injections in neonatal rats. Following maturation, animals received 25g-cm contusive SCI at T10. After plateau of locomotor recovery at 6 weeks, daily stretching was performed for 3 weeks, followed by 2 weeks without stretch, and again for two additional weeks. Animals were sacrificed 2 h after the last stretching session for histological assessments. Consistent with previous findings, stretch-induced drops in locomotor function were observed in nociceptor-intact animals but were nearly absent in nociceptor-depleted animals. These functional changes were accompanied by corresponding increases in the number of c-Fos+ nuclei throughout the lumbar enlargement. As expected, nociceptor-depleted animals had very little CGRP+ axonal innervation of the dorsal horn. Nociceptor-intact stretched animals had significantly higher levels of CGRP+ as compared to non-stretched SCI rats, suggesting that stretching promoted intraspinal CGRP+ sprouting. These results indicate that stretch-induced locomotor dysfunction in animals with incomplete SCI involves C-fibers, adding a negative post-SCI role to their adaptive roles (e.g., bladder control), and suggesting that the clinical use of muscle stretching to combat contractures and spasticity may be unintentionally detrimental to locomotor function.",

Pyocyanin has affinity for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which is expressed on adipocytes and regulates adipocyte differentiation. The purpose of this study was to define in vitro and in vivo effects of pyocyanin on adipocyte differentiation and body weight regulation as relates to septic cachexia. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, pyocyanin activated AhR and its downstream marker CYP1a1, and reduced differentiation. Administration of pyocyanin to male C57BL/6J mice acutely reduced body temperature with altered locomotion, but caused sustained weight loss. Chronic pyocyanin administration to male and female C57BL/6J mice resulted in sustained reductions in body weight and fat mass, with adipose-specific AhR activation. Pyocyanin-treated male mice had decreased energy expenditure and physical activity, and increased adipose explant lipolysis. In females, pyocyanin caused robust reductions in body weight, adipose-specific AhR activation, and increased expression of inflammatory cytokines in differentiated adipocytes. These results demonstrate that pyocyanin reduces adipocyte differentiation and decreases body weight and fat mass in male and female mice, suggesting that pyocyanin may play a role in septic cachexia.",

Furthermore, we investigated the effects of time-restricted feeding (TRF; a limitation of HFD access to 6 h each day) on energy metabolism during different periods throughout the 24-h day. In control mice, molecular leptin sensitivity was highest at zeitgeber time (ZT)0 (lights on), declining during the light phase, and increasing during the dark phase. Surprisingly, leptin resistance in HFD-fed mice was only present from the middle of the dark to the middle of the light period. Specifically, when TRF occurred from ZT21 to ZT3 (when leptin resistance in HFD-fed mice was most profound), it resulted in a disruption of the daily rhythms of locomotor activity and energy expenditure and in increased plasma insulin levels compared with other TRF periods. These data provide evidence that leptin sensitivity is controlled by the circadian rhythm and that TRF periods may be most efficient when aligned with the leptin-sensitive period.-Boucsein, A., Rizwan, M.

The important criteria for estimating the selective habitat facing by <i>S. olivacea</i> is a considerate of (1) the behavioral range in response to abiotic factors (and how it adapt ontogenetically) and (2) the movement of the crab under wild velocities situations. This work purposes to recognize the performance, locomotion rate and escaping capability of <i>S. olivacea</i> under stagnant and flowing water situations and to discuss the significance of horizontal walking to habitat choice. The collective outcomes clearly show that the locomotor activities and escaping capabilities of <i>S. olivacea</i> were influenced by water flow in the mangrove habitats.

Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) typically respond to starvation by suppressing sleep and enhancing locomotor activity presumably to search for food. However, we hypothesized that in a natural population, there are costs and benefits to sleep suppression under low-nutrient conditions and that conserving energy through sleep could be a better strategy depending on food availability. In this study, we quantified the variation in sleep-related traits in 21 wild-derived inbred lines from Katsunuma, Japan, under fed and starved conditions, and analyzed the relationship between those traits and starvation tolerance. While most of the lines responded to starvation by suppressing the total time in sleep, there were indeed two lines that responded by significantly increasing the sleep-bout durations, and thus, not reducing the total time in sleep. These genotypes survived longer in acute starvation conditions compared to genotypes that responded by the immediate suppression of sleep, which could be due to the reduced metabolic rate during the long uninterrupted sleep bouts. The coexistence of the enhanced foraging and resting strategies upon starvation within a single population is consistent with the presence of a behavioral trade-off between food search and energy conservation due to unpredictable food availability in nature. These results provide insights into the evolutionary mechanisms that contribute to the maintenance of genetic variations underlying environmental stress resistance.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of tacrolimus on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the critical protein for maintenance of neuronal functions, in the hippocampus in a diabetic condition. A diabetic rat model was established by a single streptozotocin injection (60 mg/kg). Control and diabetic rats then received daily tacrolimus (1.5 mg/kg per day) injections for 6 weeks. BDNF expression in the hippocampus was examined in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 region using immunohistochemistry. There was a significant decrease of BDNF expression in the DG and CA3 region in tacrolimus-treated and diabetic rats compared with that of the control group injected with vehicle only. However, there was no difference in BDNF expression between the two experimental groups. Tacrolimus treatment in diabetic rats further decreased the BDNF expression level in the DG and CA3 region. Interestingly, mossy fiber sprouting, demonstrated by prominent punctate immunolabeling of BDNF with synaptoporin, was observed in the diabetic group treated with tacrolimus, which localized at the stratum oriens of the CA3 region. These data suggest that tacrolimus treatment or a diabetic condition decreases BDNF expression in the hippocampus, and that tacrolimus treatment in the diabetic condition further injures the CA3 region of the hippocampus. In addition to BDNF expression, decreased locomotor activity and evident depressive behavior were observed in tacrolimus-treated diabetic rats. Moreover, there were significant decreases of the mRNA levels of γ-aminobutyric acid and serotonin receptors in the diabetic hippocampus with tacrolimus treatment. This finding suggests that tacrolimus treatment may cause further psychiatric and neurological complications for patients with diabetes, and should thus be used with caution.",

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential and neuroprotective mechanisms of piperine in an experimental mouse model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) induced by intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of streptozotocin (STZ). STZ was infused bilaterally at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day on day 1 and day 3. From day 8, piperine (2.5-10 mg/kg body weight) was administered intraperitoneally once daily for 15 consecutive days. The locomotor activity and cognitive performance of mice were evaluated using open field test and Morris water maze test, respectively. On day 23, all animals were sacrificed, and the hippocampus was used for biochemical, neurochemical and neuroinflammatory determinations. Our data revealed that the ICV-STZ-infused sAD mouse showed an increased oxidative-nitrosative stress, an altered neurotransmission and an elevated neuroinflammation in hippocampus, as well as significant cognitive deficits. All these alterations can be ameliorated by piperine in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, our findings predict a therapeutic potential of piperine against cognitive deficits in sAD mouse. This effect might be due to its abilities to ameliorate oxidative-nitrosative stress, restore neurotransmission and reduce neuroinflammation.",

We propose a modified Calcanail technique by adding a transfixation screw to improve stability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical stability of the modified Calcanail system and compare it with the traditional Calcanail system and plate fixation. A Sanders type-IIIAB calcaneal fracture model was built and simulated fixation with the three implants. A vertical loading of 700 N was applied to the subtalar joint surfaces, and the posteroinferior calcaneal tuberosity was fixed. Construct stiffness, fracture migration, and von Mises stress were assessed. The results showed the modified Calcanail system demonstrated the highest construct stiffness, smallest migration, and lowest von Mises stress among three fixations. The study suggested that the modified Calcanail system can provide comparatively sufficient stability, that makes it preferable to treat complex calcaneal fractures.",

Several recent studies have suggested receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3) plays an important role in necrosis in many cell types. However, it is still unclear what downstream events that lead to cell death are triggered by RIP3 activation. Hence, link between RIP3 inhibition and induction of neuronal cell death via mitochondrial function and antioxidative capacity after SCI was studied in our work. We examined the protective effects of RIP3 inhibition in SCI-mice. Furthermore, mimicking the pathological conditions of SCI in vitro, spinal cord neurons were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation. Notably, we found GSK872 and Nec-1 ameliorated the locomotor function and spinal cord edema, and conferred reverse of SCI-induced loss of mitochondrial integrity, ATP, glutathione and superoxide dismutase and elevation of reactive oxygen species and malonyldialdehyde in SCI-mice. Moreover, GSK872 alleviated OGD-inducted mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased antioxidative capacity and cell death in spinal cord neurons, through inhibiting RIP3 activity. The data suggest improving antioxidative capacity as a potential multifunctional treatment after SCI and the broader possibility of targeting RIP3 activity as a therapeutic window for spinal neuroprotective intervention.",

However, the potential need for arthroplasty after proximal humeral fracture fixation may still arise. Placing a humeral stem in the presence of an existing intramedullary fibular graft is challenging because the fibula is dense cortical bone and is typically well-integrated by the time an arthroplasty would be performed. Some have proposed burring the proximal humerus open to receive a stem, or using cannulated intramedullary reamers until a humeral stem can be placed. These steps are tedious and inefficient. We have found the most efficient technique as treating the fibula as if it were a well-fixed humeral stem: freeing it up from the native bone and removing it in its entirety.",

Although at therapeutic doses loperamide is devoid of central effects, it may exert them if used at high doses or combined with drugs that increase its systemic and/or central bioavailability. Recently, public health and scientific interest on loperamide has increased due to a growing trend of misuse and abuse, and consequent reports on its toxicity. Our aim was to evaluate in the rat the effects of increasing loperamide doses, with increasing likelihood to induce central effects, on gastrointestinal motor function (including gastric dysmotility and nausea-like behavior).",

Toxicity attributed to TCS has recently become a focus of research. Recent studies showed that TCS can easily migrate into the human brain and animal tissues and cause adverse changes in various target organs. Our knowledge of the neurotoxicity of TCS is largely based on very limited data. In this regard, adult male NMRI mice were administered TCS (1000, 2000, and 4000 mg/kg) by gavage for 14 consecutive days, whereas the control animals were given corn oil. At the end of the exposure, all mice were evaluated for locomotor activity, motor coordination and anxiety behaviors through the use of an open-field test, rotarod test, and elevated-plus maze (EPM) test, and for muscle strength in a grip strength test. A significant change in locomotor activity and coordination was observed in TCS treated mice. In parallel anxiety-like behaviors and muscle strength were affected by TCS. Haematoxylin-eosin staining also showed significant adverse effects in brain tissue of the TCS exposed mice. Based on these results, we conclude that a 14-day TCS exposure resulting in some behavioral disturbances in mice.",

Previous studies of intact male P. leucopus utilized two wild-derived bidirectional selection lines, a short photoperiod responsive (R) line selected for reproductive suppression in short-day conditions (SD) and a nonresponsive (NR) line selected for reproductive maturity in SD. NR mice in SD had greater food intake, but also higher levels of locomotor activity, and basal metabolic rate (BMR) than R mice. We hypothesized that testosterone may be a key mediator of this metabolic difference, as it is likely to be significantly reduced in R SD mice. Male P. leucopus from either line in SD were castrated and given either an implant containing testosterone (T) or a sham control (C). They were then tested for variation in metabolic rate and activity in SD, thermoneutral conditions. T mice had significantly higher levels of food intake, testosterone, and seminal vesicle dry weight than C mice. Seminal vesicle dry weight was significantly and positively correlated with average testosterone level, indicating an effect of the T implants. There was no statistically significant difference among treatment groups in BMR and average daily metabolic rate, suggesting that differences in testosterone alone are not the cause of differences in metabolic rate between selection lines.",

The overall aim was to detect any signs of aversive responses to this noise to enable keepers to recognize these and take any necessary mitigating actions during the construction period. The experimental approach involved the creation of acoustic maps of each focal animal enclosure, a series of 90-min video recordings of the animals' behavior in response to ambient noise (control) and amplified broadcast of pre-recorded continuous and intermittent construction noise. Concentration of fecal corticosterone metabolites was also measured for the emus. Key findings were that giraffes, elephants and emus appeared to show an increase in behaviors that could indicate stress or agitation including vigilance and locomotion and may prefer quieter regions of their enclosure during sound exposure. Giraffes also increased close contact with conspecifics when exposed to construction noise. While alligators did not show clear evidence of noise-related stress, our findings indicated that all focal species showed some behavioral responses to recorded construction noise.",

Hence, we here aimed to assess if targeted anti-diabetic therapies (Liraglutide and Fenretinide) would attenuate the diabetic and behavioural phenotype of these mice. PLB4 mice and wild-type (WT) controls were administered Liraglutide or Fenretinide for ten consecutive weeks alongside vehicle-treated mice. Physiological (body weight and mass composition, glucose tolerance, serum hormone concentration), behavioural (locomotor activity) and molecular assessments were performed in mice pre- and post-treatment. Liraglutide and Fenretinide treatments inhibited adiposity gain and decreased circulating serum triglyceride (with Liraglutide) and leptin (with Fenretinide) levels in PLB4 mice. We also found that PLB4 mice exhibited increased levels of serum dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), together with up-regulated hepatic expression of Dpp4, retinol binding protein 4 (Rbp4) and sterol regulatory element-binding 1c (Srebp1c), which was normalised by both treatments. Interestingly, Liraglutide treatment slowed down habituation to a novel environment and increased secondary night activity peak in WT mice, suggesting an impact on circadian activity regulation. However, neither treatment improved glucose homeostasis in PLB4 mice, implying that impaired glucose metabolism in this genotype may not be associated with glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and/or RBP4-mediated pathways. In summary, this study provides new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal BACE1-mediated metabolic regulation and implicates BACE1 as a putative regulator of systemic DPP4 levels.",

But there is a considerable rate of graft failure like resorption or deformation. To improve graft survival and function, accurate understanding of the properties of the recipient site is indispensable. Therefore 10 noses of human cadavers were meticulously dissected and specimens of alar and septal cartilage subjected to confined compression and tensile tests. Furthermore, cell number, glycosaminoglycan and hydroxyproline content were measured. RESULTS: showed a significant difference (p < 0.05) of alar and septal cartilage regarding Equilibrium Modulus, cell number and glycosaminoglycan but not hydroxyproline content. Tensile tests showed a significant difference (p < 0.001) between alar and septal cartilage (vertical vector of force) for E-modulus, maximal force and maximal strain but not for horizontal vector of force. There was a significant difference (p < 0.05) within septal cartilage samples depending on vector of force (vertical vs. horizontal).

However, there remains considerable debate about its limb proportions. There are three competing, but not necessarily mutually exclusive, explanations for the high humerofemoral index of A.L. 288-1: (1) a retention of proportions from an Ardipithecus-like chimp/human last common ancestor (CLCA); (2) indication of some degree of climbing ability; (3) allometry. Recent discoveries of other partial skeletons of Australopithecus, such as those of Australopithecus sediba (MH1 and MH2) and Australopithecus afarensis (KSD-VP-1/1 and DIK-1/1), have provided new opportunities to test hypotheses of early hominin body size and limb proportions. Yet, no early hominin is as complete (>90%), as is the ∼3.67 Ma 'Little Foot' (StW 573) skeleton from Sterkfontein Member 2. Here, we provide the first descriptions of its upper and lower long limb bones, as well as a comparative context of its limb proportions. We found that StW 573 possesses absolutely longer limb lengths than A.L. 288-1, but both skeletons show similar limb proportions. This finding seems to argue against a purely allometric explanation for A.L. 288-1 limb proportions. In fact, our multivariate allometric analysis suggests that limb lengths of Australopithecus, as represented by StW 573 and A.L. 288-1, exhibit a significantly different (p < 0.001) allometric pattern than that which typifies modern humans and African apes. Like some previous analyses, our results also suggest that hominin limb evolution occurred in two stages with: first, a modest increase in lower limb length and a concurrent shortening of the antebrachium between Ardipithecus and Australopithecus, followed by a considerable lengthening of the lower limb along with a decrease of both upper limb elements occurring between Australopithecus and Homo sapiens.",

Here we describe neck and shaft cross-sectional structure of all the femoral fossils recovered in the Dinaledi Chamber and compare them to a broad sample of fossil hominins, recent humans, and extant apes. Cross-sectional geometric (CSG) properties from the femoral neck (base of neck and midneck) and diaphysis (subtrochanteric region and midshaft) were obtained through CT scans for H. naledi and through CT scans or from the literature for the comparative sample. The comparison of CSG properties of H. naledi and the comparative samples shows that H. naledi femoral neck is quite derived with low superoinferior cortical thickness ratio and high relative cortical area. The neck appears superoinferiorly elongated because of two bony pilasters on its superior surface. Homo naledi femoral shaft shows a relatively thick cortex compared to the other hominins. The subtrochanteric region of the diaphysis is mediolaterally elongated resembling early hominins while the midshaft is anteroposteriorly elongated, indicating high mobility levels. In term of diaphyseal robusticity, the H. naledi femur is more gracile that other hominins and most apes.

This study used pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the impact of repeated AMPH exposure and alterations in brain DHA levels on AMPH-induced brain activation patterns. Male rats were fed a diet with no <i>n</i>-3 fatty acids (Deficient, DEF, <i>n</i> = 20), a diet fortified with preformed DHA (fish oil, FO, <i>n</i> = 20), or a control diet fortified with alpha-linolenic acid (<i>n</i> = 20) from P21 to P90. During adolescence (P40-60), one-half of each diet group received daily AMPH injections escalated weekly (0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 mg/kg/d) or drug vehicle. Following a 30-d abstinence period blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses were determined in a 7 T Bruker Biospec system following an AMPH challenge (7.5 mg/kg, i.v). Postmortem erythrocyte and forebrain DHA composition were determined by gas chromatography. Compared with control rats, forebrain and erythrocyte DHA levels were significantly lower in DEF rats and significantly higher in FO rats. Across AMPH doses DEF rats exhibited greater locomotor activity compared to control and FO rats. In AMPH-naïve rats, the AMPH challenge increased BOLD activity in the substantia nigra and basal forebrain and no diet group differences were observed. In AMPH-pretreated control and FO rats, the AMPH challenge similarly increased BOLD activation in the bilateral caudate putamen, thalamus, and motor and cingulate cortices. In contrast, BOLD activation in AMPH-pretreated DEF rats was similar to AMPH-naïve DEF animals, and AMPH-pretreated DEF rats exhibited attenuated frontostriatal BOLD activation compared with AMPH-pretreated control and FO rats. These findings demonstrate that chronic escalating AMPH treatment induces enduring frontostriatal recruitment and that peri-adolescent deficits in brain DHA accrual impair this response.",

This is partly due to the high cost and breakability of used automatic devices. Since last decade, smartphones are becoming ubiquitous. Meanwhile, several applications detecting activity by using internal sensors were made available. In this study, we assumed that this device could be a cheaper and easier way to measure the LA rhythm in humans and large mammals, like camel and goat. A smartphone application (Nokia Mate Health), normally used to quantify physical activities in humans, was chosen for the study. To validate the rhythm data obtained from the smartphone, LA rhythm was simultaneously recorded using an automatic device, the Actiwatch-Mini®. Results showed that the smartphone provided a clear and significant daily rhythm of LA. The visual assessment of the superimposed LA rhythm's curves in all three species showed that the smartphone application displayed similar rhythms as those recorded by the Actiwatch-Mini. Highly significant positive correlation (<i>p</i>≤ 0.0001) exists between the two recording rhythms. The daily periods were both the same at 24.0 h. Acrophases were also significantly similar and occurring around mid-day: 11:40 ± 0.35 h vs 11:41 ± 0.35 h for the camel, 11:25 ± 0.19 h vs 11:37 ± 0.25 h for the goat and 13:04 ± 0.11 h vs 13:51 ± 0.28 h for humans using smartphone and Actiwatch, respectively. The related mesor and amplitude were also close between the two recording devices. Results indicate clearly that using smartphones constitutes a reliable cheap tool to study LA rhythm for chronobiology studies, especially in laboratories facing lack of funding.",

We ask how energy minimization influences adaptive learning during human locomotion to improve economy when walking on a split-belt treadmill. We use a model-based approach to predict how people should adjust their walking pattern to take advantage of the assistance provided by the treadmill, and we validate these predictions empirically. We show that adaptation to a split-belt treadmill can be explained as a process by which people reduce step length asymmetry to take advantage of the work performed by the treadmill to reduce metabolic cost. Our results also have implications for the evaluation of devices designed to reduce effort during walking, as locomotor adaptation may serve as a model approach to understand how people learn to take advantage of external assistance.",

The atlas-axis complex is a mammalian innovation that allows precise head movements during these behaviors. While morphological variation in other vertebral regions has been linked to ecological differences in mammals, less is known about morphological specialization in the cervical vertebrae, which are developmentally constrained in number but highly variable in size and shape. Here, we present the first phylogenetic comparative study of the atlas-axis complex across mammals. We used spherical harmonics to quantify 3D shape variation of the atlas and axis across a diverse sample of species, and performed phylogenetic analyses to investigate if vertebral shape is associated with body size, locomotion, and diet. We found that differences in atlas and axis shape are partly explained by phylogeny, and that mammalian subclades differ in morphological disparity. Atlas and axis shape diversity is associated with differences in body size and locomotion; large terrestrial mammals have craniocaudally elongated vertebrae, while smaller mammals and aquatic mammals have more compressed vertebrae. These results provide a foundation for investigating functional hypotheses underlying the evolution of neck morphologies across mammals. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

Understanding the expansion and dispersal limits of these species is essential. As previous studies have demonstrated increased locomotor performance for populations at the edge of the range of expanding populations, studies of locomotion including the anatomical and physiological traits underlying dispersal capacity are of interest. We focus here on an invasive population of Xenopus laevis introduced in France nearly forty years ago. Previous studies have demonstrated differences in mobility between populations from the centre and the edge of the invasive range, with individuals from the range edge possessing a higher endurance capacity. We test here whether range-edge frogs show anatomical differences in organs or muscles underlying these observed differences of performance. We dissected 10 males and 10 females from central and range-edge sites (40 animals in total) and measured the mass of their organs and the mass, the length, and the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of 28 hind limb muscles. Our results show anatomical differences with individuals from the range edge possessing heavier, longer and more forceful muscles. Moreover, females from the range edge had a heavier heart but lighter stomach than those of the centre of the range. Future studies comparing the morphology between native and invasive populations in other regions or for other species will be especially insightful to better understand the possible adaptive changes in invasive populations and the limits on dispersal capacity.",

Using intrauterine lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration to induce a localized, rather than a systemic, inflammation, we have previously shown that IUI increases cytokine expression and microglia number, and reduces white matter in the brains of exposed offspring. Clinical data suggest that IUI may increase the risk for cognitive and neurodevelopmental disorders, however, IUI is often found in the context of preterm birth, making it difficult to disentangle the adverse effects of inflammation from those related to prematurity. Therefore, using a mouse model of IUI that does not involve preterm birth, operant tasks were used to evaluate motivation, attention, impulsivity, and locomotion. IUI-exposed offspring were found to have increased locomotion and increased motivation (females only), and testing in the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) showed that IUI-exposed offspring performed more trials and could respond accurately at a shorter stimulus length. We have previously shown that IUI animals have a potentiated cytokine response to a ""second hit"" (acute LPS injection) in adulthood, so animals' performance in the 5CSRTT was evaluated following an acute injection of LPS. As opposed to the improved performance observed under baseline conditions, IUI exposed animals demonstrated a greater decrease in performance after an acute LPS administration. To identify putative molecular mechanisms underlying this potentiated decline in cognitive performance, PFC samples were collected immediately after post-LPS cognitive testing and targeted gene expression analysis was correlated with specific measures of cognitive performance. Three receptors important for neuron-microglia crosstalk were found to correlate with task performance in the males following acute LPS administration. These data demonstrate that early life exposure to localized inflammation of the uterus, in the absence of prematurity, increases locomotor activity and improves some aspects of cognitive performance, but drives a vulnerability for adult cognitive performance deficits in response to acute infection.",

We quantified the absolute aerobic scope of house and Spanish sparrows, Passer domesticus and P. hispaniolensis, respectively, before and during sequential stages of their moult period. The absolute aerobic scope (AAS) is the difference between maximum metabolic rate (MMR) during peak locomotor activities and minimum resting metabolic rate (RMR<sub>min</sub>), thus representing the amount of aerobic power above that committed to maintenance needs available for other activities. As expected, RMR<sub>min</sub> increased over the moult period by up to 40 and 63% in house and Spanish sparrows, respectively. Surprisingly, the maximum metabolic rates also decreased during moult in both species, declining as much as 25 and 38% compared with pre-moult values of house and Spanish sparrows, respectively. The concurrent changes in RMR<sub>min</sub> and MMR during moult resulted in significant decreases in AAS, being up to 32 and 47% lower than pre-moult levels of house and Spanish sparrows, respectively, during moult stages having substantial feather replacement. We argue that the combination of reduced flight efficiency due to loss of wing feathers and reduced aerobic capacity places moulting birds at greater risk of predation. Such performance constraints likely contribute to most birds temporally separating moult from annual events requiring peak physiological capacity such as breeding and migration.",

These include kinetic tremor, gait ataxia, and impaired motor adaptation. Previous studies of motor adaptation in ET have focused on reaching while the effects of ET on gait adaptation are currently unknown. The purpose of this study was to contrast locomotor adaptation in persons with and without ET. We hypothesized that persons with ET would show impaired gait adaptation. In a cross-sectional study, persons with ET (n=14) and healthy matched controls (n=12) walked on a split-belt treadmill. Participants walked with the belts moving at a 2:1 ratio, followed by overground walking to test transfer, followed by a readaptation period and finally a deadaptation period. Step length asymmetry was measured to assess the rate of adaptation, amount of transfer, and rates of readaptation and deadaptation. Spatial, temporal, and velocity contributions to¬ step length asymmetry were analyzed during adaptation. There were no group by condition interactions in step length asymmetry or contributions to step length asymmetry. Regardless of condition, persons with ET walked slower and exhibited lower temporal (p < 0.001) and velocity (p = 0.001) contributions to step length asymmetry than controls. Persons with ET demonstrated a preserved ability to adapt to, store, and transfer a new walking pattern. Despite probable cerebellar involvement in ET, locomotor adaptation is an available mechanism to teach persons with ET new gait patterns.",

The gene has been identified as the cause of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) and it has been implicated in various other neuropsychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, and autism. However, the precise molecular mechanisms of the gene's involvement in neurogenesis, particularly, corticogenesis, are not well understood. Here, we present data showing that TCF4 is expressed in a region-specific manner in the radial glia and stem cells of transient embryonic zones at early gestational ages in both humans and mice. TCF4 haploinsufficiency mice exhibit a delay in neuronal migration, and a significant increase in the number of upper-layer cortical neurons, as well as abnormal dendrite and synapse formation. Our research also reveals that TCF3 up-regulates Tcf4 by binding to the specific ""E-box"" and its flank sequence in intron 2 of the Tcf4 gene. Additionally, our transcriptome study substantiates that Tcf4 transcriptional function is essential for locomotion, cognition, and learning. By activating expression of TCF4 in the regulation of neuronal proliferation and migration to the overlaying neocortex and subsequent differentiation leading to laminar formation TCF4 fulfills its normal function, but if not, abnormalities such as those reported here result. These findings provide new insight into the specific roles of Tcf4 molecular pathway in neocortical development and their relevance in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases.",

Blood returns from the lower limb drawn to the heart by the low pressure at the vena cava through hydrodynamic forces. Resisting these hydrodynamics forces are gravitational and frictional forces. The deficit between the forces acting for venous return from the lower limb by hydrodynamics and those acting against antegrade flow, is filled by extrinsic mechanical mechanisms including the respiratory pump, skeletal muscle pumps and the foot pump. The efficiency of the lower limb skeletal muscle pump and foot pump are likely linked to gait kinetics and kinematics. A model is proposed that attempts to expand upon previous gait models of the foot pump as part of the kinetic and kinematic events that occur during gait, whilst also developing the argument that the foot pump needs to be divided into passive-pressure phases, and combined active-muscular/passive-pressure phases during gait. This model suggests that non-weightbearing arch profiles will have little influence on the combined active/passive-pressure phases of the foot pump, while the ability to develop compliance and stiffness within the foot at the requisite periods of the gait cycle is likely to influence foot pump efficiency.",

Gesture-speech synchrony has been understood as completely governed by sophisticated neural-cognitive mechanisms. However, gesture-speech synchrony may have its original basis in the resonating forces that travel through the body. In the current preregistered study, movements with high physical impact affected phonation in line with gesture-speech synchrony as observed in natural contexts. Rhythmic beating of the arms entrained phonation acoustics (F0 and the amplitude envelope). Such effects were absent for a condition with low-impetus movements (wrist movements) and a condition without movement. Further, movement-phonation synchrony was more pronounced when participants were standing as opposed to sitting, indicating a mediating role for postural stability. We conclude that gesture-speech synchrony has a biomechanical basis, which will have implications for our cognitive, ontogenetic, and phylogenetic understanding of multimodal language.

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the feasibility of using body worn accelerometers to identify previous highlighted performance related biomechanical changes in terms of substantial differences across skill levels and skating phases. Twenty-two ice hockey players of different caliber were equipped with two 3D accelerometers, located on the skate and the waist, as they performed 30 m forward skating sprints on an ice rink. Two measures of the temporal stride characteristics (contact time and stride time) and one measure of the propulsive power (stride propulsion) of a skating stride were calculated and checked for discriminating effects across (i) skill levels and (ii) sprint phases as well as for their (iii) strength of association with the sprint performance (total sprint time). High caliber players showed an increased stride propulsion (+22%, <i>P </i><<i> </i>0.05) and shorter contact time (-5%, <i>P </i><<i> </i>0.05).

In addition to their passive biomechanical role in pressure and shear reduction, in the near future, prophylactic dressings may also provide active tissue protection by releasing preventive agents or drugs into skin and deeper tissues. We investigated delivery of sodium pyruvate (NaPy) from an active dressing to potentially protect the sacral skin and underlying tissues in addition. We used four finite element model variants describing different skin roughness levels to determine time profiles of NaPy diffusion from the dressing into the skin layers. The NaPy concentrations for the different modelled cases stabilised after 1 to 6.5 hours from the time of application of the dressings, at 1% to 3% of the NaPy concentration in the dressing reservoir, which is considered potent. We conclude that prophylactic sacral dressings have the potential to deliver NaPy into skin and subdermally, to potentially increase soft tissue tolerance to sustained bodyweight-caused cell and tissue deformations. The time durations to achieve the steady-state potent NaPy dermal concentrations are clinically feasible, for example, for preparation of patients for surgery or for use in intensive care units.",

Therefore, understanding the regulation of muscle mass is of significant importance. Resistance exercise training (RET) combined with supportive nutrition is an effective strategy to achieve muscle hypertrophy by driving chronic elevations in muscle protein synthesis (MPS). The regulation of muscle protein synthesis is a coordinated process, in requiring ribosomes to translate mRNA and sufficient myonuclei density to provide the platform for ribosome and mRNA transcription; as such MPS is determined by both translational efficiency (ribosome activity) and translational capacity (ribosome number). Moreover, as the muscle protein pool expands during hypertrophy, translation capacity (i.e. ribosomes and myonuclei content) could theoretically become rate-limiting such that an inability to expand these pools through ribosomal biogenesis and satellite cell (SC) mediated myonuclear addition could limit growth potential. Simple measures of RNA (ribosome content) and DNA (SC/Myonuclei number) concentrations reveal that these pools do increase with hypertrophy; yet whether these adaptations are a pre-requisite or a limiting factor for hypertrophy is unresolved and highly debated. This is primarily due to methodological limitations and many assumptions being made on static measures or correlative associations. However recent advances within the field using stable isotope tracers shows promise in resolving these questions in muscle adaptation.",

Patients' self-reported Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score questionnaires, magnetic resonance imaging, and three-dimensional gait analysis were obtained in 53 subjects with patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis at baseline and after one year. Joint osteoarthritis was diagnosed on knee magnetic resonance images if cartilage lesions existed. Progression was defined by worsening of patients' self-reported symptoms from baseline to one year exceeding the minimal detectable change score. Analysis of covariance was used to compare peak knee flexion moment, knee flexion moment impulse, and vertical ground reaction force loading rate between progressors and non-progressors. Seven (13.2%) subjects exhibited progression in self-reported symptoms at one-year follow-up. When comparing to non-progressors, significantly higher peak knee flexion moment during first half of stance (p = 0.017) and higher moment impulse during the both halves of stance were observed among progressors (p = 0.020~0.040). Persons with symptomatic patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis progression with or without concurrent tibiofemoral osteoarthritis exhibited abnormal joint loading mechanics when compared to individuals who did not progress. Further work is needed to determine if modification to these loading variables results in a change in the symptomatic progression in these individuals. This article is protected by copyright.

This study was conducted to clarify the relationship between Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and parathyroid hormone receptor 1 (PTH1R) signaling in modulating the enhanced chondrocyte terminal differentiation in dental stimulated TMJ osteoarthritic cartilage. A gain- and loss-of-function strategy was used in an in vitro model in which fluid flow shear stress (FFSS) was applied, and in an in vivo model in which the unilateral anterior cross-bite (UAC) stimulation was adopted. Ihh and PTH1R signaling was modulated through treating the isolated chondrocytes with inhibitor/activator and via deleting <i>Smoothened</i> (<i>Smo</i>) and/or <i>Pth1r</i> genes in mice with the promoter gene of type 2 collagen (<i>Col2-CreER</i>) in the tamoxifen-inducible pattern. We found that both FFSS and UAC stimulation promoted the deep zone chondrocytes to undergo terminal differentiation, while cells in the superficial zone were robust. We demonstrated that the terminal differentiation process in deep zone chondrocytes promoted by FFSS and UAC was mediated by the enhanced Ihh signaling and declined PTH1R expression. The FFSS-promoted terminal differentiation was suppressed by administration of the Ihh inhibitor or PTH1R activator. The UAC-promoted chondrocytes terminal differentiation and OA-like lesions were rescued in <i>Smo</i> knockout, but were enhanced in <i>Pth1r</i> knockout mice. Importantly, the relieving effect of <i>Smo</i> knockout mice was attenuated when <i>Pth1r</i> knockout was also applied.

Six synchronised swimmers performed two, 30 s maximal intensity, fully tethered standard and contra-standard sculling motions. Kinetic and kinematic data were obtained using a load-cell and underwater cameras, respectively. Force decreased along both techniques' bouts, but no differences in-between techniques were noted for any kinetic variables. Standard sculling presented a higher cycle rate and a lower elbow mean angle than the contra-standard sculling (2.4 ± 0.3 vs. 2.0 ± 0.2 cycles/s and 134.1 ± 5.8 and 141.5 ± 4.7°, <i>p</i> < 0.05).

However, the underlying mechanisms causing this abnormality remain unknown. Central command (CC) and the exercise pressor reflex (EPR) are known to contribute significantly to cardiovascular control during exercise. Thus these neural signals are viable candidates for the generation of the abnormal circulatory regulation in this disease. We hypothesized that augmentations in CC as well as EPR function contribute to the heightened cardiovascular responses during exercise in T2DM. To test this hypothesis, changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) in response to electrical stimulation of mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), a putative component of the central command pathway, and activation of the EPR, evoked by electrically induced hindlimb muscle contraction, were examined in decerebrate animals. Sprague-Dawley rats were given either a normal diet (control) or a high-fat diet (14-16 wk) in combination with two low doses (35 mg/kg <i>week 1</i>, 25 mg/kg <i>week 2</i>) of streptozotocin (T2DM). The changes in MAP and RSNA responses to MLR stimulation were significantly greater in T2DM compared with control (2,739 ± 123 vs. 1,298 ± 371 mmHg/s, 6,326 ± 1,621 vs. 1,390 ± 277%/s, respectively, <i>P</i> < 0.05).

For this aim, 30 variables including immune functions, inflammatory-oxidative stress state and behavioural characteristics were investigated in ICR-CD1 female mice at the adult age (N = 38). Mice were monitored individually until they died and individual life spans were registered. Multiple linear regression was carried out to construct an Immunity model (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 75.8%) comprising Macrophage chemotaxis and phagocytosis and Lymphoproliferation capacity, a Redox model (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 84.4%) involving Reduced Glutathione and Malondialdehide concentrations and Glutathione Peroxidase activity and a Behavioural model (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 79.8%) comprising Internal Locomotion and Time spent in open arms indices.

To examine the relationship between energy metabolism and locomotor variation during osmoregulation, Chinese shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis were held at 30‰, 25‰, 20‰, 15‰, and 10‰ salinity for 15 days, after which the activities of key enzymes involved in glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and electron transport chain in posterior gills, pleopods, and abdominal muscles were determined. Hemolymph osmolality, oxygen consumption rates, swimming and tail-flipping abilities were also obtained. Results showed that hemolymph of F. chinensis was isosmotic to brackish water at 25‰ salinity. The rate of oxygen consumption increased by 27.8% to 126.0% during osmoregulation. Activities of citrate synthase (CS) and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) increased in posterior gill rather than muscles during osmoregulation. In muscles, CS and COX activities decreased by 16.6% to 59.11% at 15‰ and 10‰ salinities, but phosphofructokinase (PFK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities decreased by 13.2% to 44.5% at 10‰ salinity. Swimming abilities were positively correlative with CS and COX activities of pleopod muscle. Tail-flipping abilities increased with PFK and LDH activities of abdominal muscles. These findings suggest that shrimp increase reliance on aerobic metabolism for fueling osmoregulation. There is an energetic trade-off between gill and muscles under salinity exposure. The energetic depression of muscles results in the reduction of shrimp locomotion during osmoregulation.",

Here, we tested whether the human visual motion areas involved in processing optic flow signals simulating self-motion are also activated by active lower limb movements, and hence are likely involved in guiding human locomotion. To this aim, we used a combined approach of task-evoked activity and resting-state functional connectivity by fMRI. We localized a set of six egomotion-responsive visual areas (V6+, V3A, intraparietal motion/ventral intraparietal [IPSmot/VIP], cingulate sulcus visual area [CSv], posterior cingulate sulcus area [pCi], posterior insular cortex [PIC]) by using optic flow. We tested their response to a motor task implying long-range active leg movements. Results revealed that, among these visually defined areas, CSv, pCi, and PIC responded to leg movements (visuomotor areas), while V6+, V3A, and IPSmot/VIP did not (visual areas). Functional connectivity analysis showed that visuomotor areas are connected to the cingulate motor areas, the supplementary motor area, and notably to the medial portion of the somatosensory cortex, which represents legs and feet. We suggest that CSv, pCi, and PIC perform the visual analysis of egomotion-like signals to provide sensory information to the motor system with the aim of guiding locomotion.",

The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of trunk speed extracted using an inertial motion system compared to a gold standard optical motion system, during steady walking and stationary periods. Eleven participants walked on pre-established paths marked on the floor. Between each lap, a 1-second stationary transition period at the initial position was included prior to the next lap. Resultant trunk speed during the walking and transition periods were extracted from an inertial (240 Hz sampling rate) and an optical system (120 Hz sampling rate) to calculate the agreement (Pearson's correlation coefficient) and relative root mean square errors between both systems. The agreement for the resultant trunk speed between the inertial system and the optical system was strong (0.67 < <i>r</i> ≤ 0.9) for both walking and transition periods. Moreover, relative root mean square error during the transition periods was greater in comparison to the walking periods (>40% across all paths). It was concluded that trunk speed extracted from inertial systems have fair accuracy during walking, but the accuracy was reduced in the transition periods.",

To date, a wide variety of cells has been used as biotherapies to cure SCI in different animal paradigms. Specifically, olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) is one of the most promising. Indeed, OECs have been shown to enhance recovery in many animal studies. Moreover, OECs transplantation has been applied to a paraplegic patient and have shown beneficial effects. However, it has been reported that the significant level of recovery varies among different patients. Therefore, it is of primary importance to enhance the regenerative efficiency of OECs for better translations. Recently, it has been shown that inhibiting ADAMTS4 expression in glial cells <i>in vitro</i> increases their synthesis of neurotrophic factors. We hypothesized that the expression of neurotrophic factors secreted by OECs can be increased by the deletion of ADAMTS4. Taking advantage of ADAMTS4<sup>-/-</sup> mouse line, we produce ADAMTS4 deficient primary OEC cultures and then we investigated their regenerative potential after SCI. By using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, bioluminescence imaging, measurement of locomotor activity, electrophysiological studies, and immunohistochemistry, our results show that ADAMTS4<sup>-/-</sup> olfactory bulb OEC (bOECs) primary cultures upregulate their trophic factor expression <i>in vitro</i>, and that the transplantation of ADAMTS4<sup>-/-</sup> bOECs in a severe SCI model increases functional recovery and tissue repair <i>in vivo</i>. Altogether, our study reveals, for the first time, that primary bOEC cultures transplantation can be potentialized by inhibition of the expression of ADAMTS4.",

A series of sectional magnetic resonance images (1.5 T) of the stifle joint of a 23 year old Shetland pony gelding served as basis for image segmentation. Based on the 3D polygon models of femur, tibia, articular cartilages, menisci, collateral ligaments and the meniscotibial ligaments, an FEM model was generated. Tissue material properties were assigned based on data from human (Open knee(s) project) and bovine femoro-tibial joint available in the literature. The FEM model was tested across a range of motion of approximately 30°. Pressure load was overall higher in the lateral meniscus than in the medial. Accordingly, the simulation showed higher translocation and deformation in the lateral compared to the medial meniscus. The results encourage further refinement of this model for studying loading patterns on menisci and articular cartilages as well as the resulting mechanical stress in the subchondral bone (femur and tibia). A functional FEM model can not only help identify segments in the stifle which are predisposed to injury, but also to better understand the progression of certain stifle disorders, simulate treatment/surgery effects and to optimize implant/transplant properties.",

However, existing scaling methods for traumatic brain injury (TBI) do not account for the anatomical and morphological complexity of the brains for different species and have not been validated based on accurate anatomy and realistic material properties. In this study, the relationship between the head impact condition and brain tissue deformation was investigated using human, baboon, and macaque brain finite element (FE) models, which featured macroscale and mesoscale anatomical details. The objective was to evaluate existing scaling methods in predicting similar biomechanical responses in the different species using both idealized and real-world head impact pulses. A second objective was to develop a new method to improve how animal data is scaled to humans. As previously found in humans, the animal's brain response to the rotational head motion was well characterized by single-degree-of-freedom (sDOF) mechanical systems with resonance at certain natural frequency, and this concept was leveraged to develop a new TBI scaling method based the natural frequency of the sDOF models representing each species. Previously described biomechanical scaling methods based on mass or inertia ratios were poor predictors of equivalent strain. The novel frequency-based scaling method was an improved approach to scaling the equivalent loading conditions. The findings of this study enable better interpretation of mechanical-trauma responses obtained from animal data to the human, thus effectively advance the development of human injury criteria and contribute towards the mitigation of TBI.",

In rodents, drug-induced behavioural sensitization has been described for several different drug classes. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist MK-801 can inhibit sensitization to other drugs of abuse. However, MK-801 also produces behavioural sensitization to its own hyperlocomotor inducing effects, suggesting that MK-801 sensitization has a distinctive mechanism of action. The aim of this study was to carry out a functional and molecular analysis of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats sensitized to MK-801 (seven daily injections of 0.25 mg/kg, 5 days of withdrawal and subsequent 0.25 mg/kg challenge), or following acute MK-801 (0.25 mg/kg), or naive rats as controls. Locomotor activity was the primary measure of sensitization. Ex-vivo slice electrophysiology showed a decrease in the excitatory synaptic strength in the NAc of rats sensitized to MK-801 compared with acute MK-801 treatment or naive controls. An LC-MS/MS SWATH proteomics approach showed that proteins altered by MK-801 sensitization were predominantly related to functions including calcium and glutamate signalling, and mitochondrial dysfunction. These results shed some light on neural changes in the NAc after sensitization to MK-801. This model could prove useful for studying the role of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the pathophysiology of drug addiction and schizophrenia.",

Regarding its involvement in the neurodegenerative process observed in Parkinson disease (PD), deep brain stimulation of the PPN was proposed to treat levodopa-resistant gait disorders. However, the precise role of the cMRF in the pathophysiology of PD, particularly in freezing of gait and other non-motor symptoms is still not clear. Here, using micro electrode recording (MER) in 2 primates, we show that dopamine depletion did not alter the mean firing rate of the overall cMRF neurons, particularly the putative non-cholinergic ones, but only a decreased activity of the regular neurons sub-group (though to be the cholinergic PPN neurons). Interestingly, a significant increase in the relative proportion of cMRF neurons with a burst pattern discharge was observed after MPTP intoxication. The present results question the hypothesis of an over-inhibition of the CMRF by the basal ganglia output structures in PD. The decreased activity observed in the regular neurons could explain some non-motor symptoms in PD regarding the strong involvement of the cholinergic neurons on the modulation of the thalamo-cortical system. The increased burst activity under dopamine depletion confirms that this specific spike discharge pattern activity also observed in other basal ganglia nuclei and in different pathologies could play a mojor role in the pathophysiology of the disease and could explain several symptoms of PD including the freezing of gait. The present data will have to be replicated in a larger number of animals and will have to investigate more in details how the modification of the spike discharge of the cMRF neurons in the parkinsonian state could alter functions such as locomotion and attentional state. This will ultimely allow a better comprehension of the pathophysiology of freezing of gait.",

This work examines the ability of BPGs to modulate the mechanical and physical properties of porcine urethras <i>ex vivo</i> to determine the feasibility of BPGs to be implemented as molecular treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI). We investigated compliance by performing a unique radial expansion testing method using urethras from six- to nine-month-old pigs. The urethras were injected with 0.5 ml BPG solution at three sites every approximately 120° (conc.: 25 mg ml<sup>-1</sup>, 50 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> and 75 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); <i>n</i> = 4 per group) and compared them with PBS-injected controls. Young's modulus was calculated by treating the urethra as a thin-walled pressure vessel. A water uptake study was performed by soaking 10 mm urethra biopsy samples that were injected with 0.1 ml BPG solution (conc.: 50 mg ml<sup>-1</sup>, 100 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> and 200 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> in 1× PBS; <i>n</i> = 6 per group) in 5 ml PBS for 24 h. Although there was no significant difference in Young's modulus data, there were differences between groups as can be seen in the raw radial expansion testing data. Results showed that BPGs have the potential to increase hydration in samples, and that there was a significant difference in water uptake between BPG-injected samples and the controls (100 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> samples versus PBS samples, <i>p</i> < 0.05). This work shows that BPGs have the potential to be implemented as a molecular treatment for SUI, by restoring the diminished proteoglycan content and subsequently increasing hydration and improving the compliance of urethral tissue.",

Mice lacking Lsamp gene display decreased social behaviour, hyperactivity; decreased anxiety level, alongside with altered balance in GABAA receptor α1 and α2 subunits; and decreased sensitivity to amphetamine, alongside with elevated serotonin function. In human studies, Lsamp has been associated with several psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, and suicide. Here, we provide a more thorough characterization of the pharmacological phenotype of Lsamp-deficient mice, including testing for sensitivity to morphine, cocaine, MK-801 and ketamine. More thorougly, sensitivity to GABA modulators (diazepam, alprazolam, ethanol, pentobarbital, TP003, and SL651498) was assessed. In brief, Lsamp-deficient mice were more sensitive to the locomotor activating effects of cocaine and morphine, and hypersensitive to the sedative and muscle relaxant effects of GABA modulators, most likely reflecting enhanced function of α1 and α5 subunits of the GABAA receptor. No gross differences in sensitivity to NMDA receptor modulators were observed. Thus, as the lack of Lsamp gene leads to widespread imbalances in major neurotransmitter systems in the brain accompanied by remarkable changes in behavioural phenotype as well, Lsamp-deficient mice are a promising model for mimicking psychiatric disorders.",

These challenges include interpreting and co-locating information between different medical imaging modalities that are used to identify tumours and predicting where these tumours move to during different treatment procedures. We have developed a novel automated breast image analysis workflow that integrates state-of-the-art image processing and machine learning techniques, personalized three-dimensional biomechanical modelling and population-based statistical analysis to assist clinicians during breast cancer detection and treatment procedures. This paper summarizes our recent research to address the various technical and implementation challenges associated with creating a fully automated system. The workflow is applied to predict the repositioning of tumours from the prone position, where diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging is performed, to the supine position where treatment procedures are performed. We discuss our recent advances towards addressing challenges in identifying the mechanical properties of the breast and evaluating the accuracy of the biomechanical models. We also describe our progress in implementing a prototype of this workflow in clinical practice. Clinical adoption of these state-of-the-art modelling techniques has significant potential for reducing the number of misdiagnosed breast cancers, while also helping to improve the treatment of patients.",

Clinical management of FM is poorly addressed with only a few available therapeutic options. Coumarins are active phenolic molecules of natural origin found to have broad pharmacological activities. Current investigation explores the role of naturally occurring coumarin, imperatorin in mouse model of fibromyalgia. Administration of reserpine (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) thrice at 24 h intervals induced behavioral and neurochemical alterations characteristic of fibromyalgia. Reserpine was found to induce allodynia quantified using electronic von Frey (e-VF) and pressure application measurement (PAM) test, depression as indicated by an increased duration of immobility in forced swim test (FST), decreased motor coordination and locomotor activity in inclined plane test (IPT) and open field test (OFT) respectively. Cognitive deficits were evident by an increased latency to locate hidden platform in Morris water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance test (PAT). Reserpine treatment was found to cause an increased anxiety as revealed by increased time spent in closed arm of the elevated plus maze (EPM). Furthermore, an up- regulation in NMDA and NFκB expression in the brain and spinal cord was observed in reserpine treated groups. Administration of imperatorin (10 mg/kg, i.p) for a period of 5 days ameliorated all behavioral deficits, biochemical changes and decreased expression of NMDA and NFκB in the brain and spinal cord of treated mice.

The goal of this study was to develop and validate a deformable T-spine for the Global Human Body Models Consortium (GHBMC) M50-O (average male occupant) human model and to demonstrate improved biofidelity. <b>Methods:</b> Eleven functional spinal units (FSUs) were developed with deformable vertebrae (cortical and trabecular), spinal and costovertebral ligaments, and intervertebral discs. Material properties for all parts were obtained from the literature. FSUs were subjected to quasistatic loads per Panjabi et al. ( 1976 ) in 6 degrees of freedom. Stiffness values were calculated for each moment (Nm/°) and translational force (N/µm). Updated costovertebral (CV) joints of ribs 2, 6, and 10 were subjected to moments along 3 axes per Duprey et al. ( 2010 ). The response was optimized by maximum force and laxity in the ligaments. In both cases, updated models were compared to the baseline approach, which employed rigid bodies and joint-like behavior. The deformable T-spine and CV joints were integrated into the full M50-O model Ver. 5.0β and 2 full-body cases were run: (1) a rear pendulum impact per Forman et al. ( 2015 ) at speeds up to 5.5 m/s. and (2) a lateral shoulder impact per Koh ( 2005 ) at 4.5 m/s. Quantitative evaluation protocols were used to evaluate the time history response vs. experimental data, with an average correlation and analysis (CORA) score of 0.76. <b>Results:</b> All FSU responses showed reduced stiffness vs. baseline. Tension, extension, torsion, and lateral bending became more compliant than experimental data. Like the experimental results, no trend was observed for joint response by level. CV joints showed good biofidelity. The response at ribs 2, 6, and 10 generally followed the experimental data. <b>Conclusions:</b> Deformable T-spine and CV joint validation has not been previously published and yielded high biofidelity in rear impact and notable improvement in lateral impact at the full body level. Future work will focus on localized T-spine injury criteria made possible by the introduction of this fully deformable representation of the anatomy.",

All specimens were tested using the universal testing machine. For numerical simulations (finite element method, element-free Galerkin method, and extended finite element method), two-dimensional model of cortical bone was developed by assuming plane strain condition. Material properties of the cortical bone were considered as anisotropic and homogeneous. The values obtained through finite element method, element-free Galerkin method, and extended finite element method are well corroborated to experimentally determined values and earlier published data. However, element-free Galerkin method and extended finite element method predict more accurate results as compared to finite element method. In the case of the transversely fractured specimen, the values of stress intensity factor and energy release rate were found to be higher as compared to the longitudinally fractured specimen, which shows consistency with earlier published data.

Exosomes were harvested from conditioned culture media of TSCs by a sequential centrifugation process. Rat Achilles tendon tendinopathy model was established by collagenase-I injection. This was followed by intra-Achilles-tendon injection with TSCs or exosomes. Tendon healing and matrix degradation were evaluated by histology analysis and biomechanical test at the post-injury 5 weeks. In vitro, TSCs treated with interleukin 1 beta were added by conditioned medium including exosomes or not, or by exosomes or not. Tendon matrix related markers and tenogenesis related markers were measured by immunostaining and western blot. We found that TSCs injection and exosomes injection significantly decreased matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-3 expression, increased expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) and Col-1a1, and increased biomechanical properties of the ultimate stress and maximum loading. In vitro, conditioned medium with exosomes and exosomes also significantly decreased MMP-3, and increased expression of tenomodulin, Col-1a1 and TIMP-3.

Unanticipated side-cut landing, compared (paired t-test, <i>p</i> < 0.05) to the anticipated landings, resulted in less hip abduction and tibial internal rotation angle at initial contact (IC) and a lower maximum ankle inversion angle and a greater maximum knee abduction angle, and knee and hip displacement. Also, greater posterior GRF and a longer time to peak medial GRF were exhibited. These outcomes indicate that athletes may adapt their landing mechanics to land unsafely when encountering an unanticipated event.",

Wearable technologies combined with a proper data analysis provide a low cost option to monitor chest and abdominal wall movements. Here we set out to determine the feasibility of using accelerometry and machine learning to detect chest-abdominal wall movement patterns during tidal breathing. Furthermore, we determined the accelerometer positions included in the clusters, considering principal component domains. Eleven healthy participants (age: 21 ± 0.2 y, BMI: 23.4 ± 0.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, FEV<sub>1</sub>: 4.1 ± 0.3 L, VO<sub>2</sub>: 4.6 ± 0.2 mL/min kg) were included in this cross-sectional study. Spirometry and ergospirometry assessments were performed with participants seated with 13 accelerometers placed over the thorax. Data collection lasted 10  min. Following signal pre-processing, principal components and clustering analyses were performed. The Euclidean distances in respect to centroids were compared between the clusters (p < 0.05), identifying two clusters (p < 0.001). The first cluster included sensors located at the right and left second rib midline, body of sternum, left fourth rib midline, right and left second thoracic vertebra midline, and fifth thoracic vertebra. The second cluster included sensors at the fourth right rib midline, right and left seventh ribs, abdomen at linea alba, and right and left tenth thoracic vertebra midline. Costal-superior and costal-abdominal patterns were also recognized. We conclude that accelerometers placed on the chest and abdominal wall permit the identification of two clusters of movements regarding respiration biomechanics.",

Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) has been associated with less successful revascularization and poor functional outcome in diabetes. We assessed whether a new thrombolytic strategy based on MMP10 was more effective than tPA in a murine IS model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. Wild-type mice were administered a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) (180 mg/kg) to develop STZ-induced diabetes mellitus. Two weeks later, IS was induced by thrombin injection into the middle cerebral artery and the effect of recombinant MMP10 (6.5 μg/kg), tPA (10 mg/kg) or tPA/MMP10 on brain damage and functional outcome were analysed. Motor activity was assessed using the open field test. Additionally, we studied plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and thrombin-antithrombin complex levels (TAT) by ELISA and oxidative stress and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity by immunohistochemistry and western blot. MMP10 treatment was more effective at reducing infarct size and neurodegeneration than tPA 24 h and 3 days after IS in diabetic mice. Locomotor activity was impaired by hyperglycemia and ischemic injury, but not by the thrombolytic treatments. Additionally, TAT, oxidative stress and BBB permeability were reduced by MMP10 treatment, whereas brain bleeding or PAI-1 expression did not differ between treatments. Thrombolytic treatment with MMP10 was more effective than tPA at reducing stroke and neurodegeneration in a diabetic murine model of IS, without increasing haemorrhage. Thus, we propose MMP10 as a potential candidate for the clinical treatment of IS in diabetic patients.",

Furthermore, based on histopathological studies, the PPN was hypothesized to play a role in the manifestation of symptoms in movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Since axial symptoms represent unmet needs of PD treatments, a series of pioneering experiments in Parkinsonian monkeys promoted the idea of a potential new target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) and much clinical interest was generated in the following years leading to a number of trials analysing the role of PPN for gait disorders.

It likely participates in some motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease and is regularly proposed as a surgical target to ameliorate gait, posture and sleep disorders in Parkinsonian patients. The PPN overlaps with the monoaminergic systems including dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline in the modulation of the above-mentioned functions. All these systems are involved in Parkinson's disease and the mechanism of the anti-Parkinsonian agents, mostly L-DOPA. This suggests that PPN interacts with monoaminergic neurons and vice versa. Some evidence indicates that the PPN sends cholinergic, glutamatergic and even gabaergic inputs to mesencephalic dopaminergic cells, with the data regarding serotonergic or noradrenergic cells being less well known. Similarly, the control exerted by the PPN on dopaminergic neurons, is multiple and complex, and more extensively explored than the other monoaminergic systems. The data on the influence of monoaminergic systems on PPN neuron activity are rather scarce. While there is evidence that the PPN influences the therapeutic response of L-DOPA, it is still difficult to discerne the reciprocal action of the PPN and monoaminergic systems in this action. Additional data are required to better understand the functional organization of monoaminergic inputs to the MLR including the PPN to get a clearer picture of their interaction.",

We investigated the efficacy and safety of this alternative autograft compared with autologous hamstring tendon (HT). Biomechanical testing of the graft options was performed and compared with the native ACL. Thirty-eight patients with acute ACL ruptures and grade III MCL injuries were treated with ACL reconstruction with a doubled autologous PLT or quadrupled autologous HT. Knee stability and function was evaluated clinically with the Lachman test and KT-2000 arthometer as well as subjectively with functional scores. Effects on the donor ankle were evaluated by biomechanical testing. The ultimate tensile strengths of doubled PLT and quadrupled HT were significantly higher than that of the native ACL and the ultimate tensile strength of doubled PLT was comparable with that of quadrupled HT. There were no significant differences in clinical or functional scores between the two groups. There were no significant differences in pre- and postoperative biomechanical testing of the donor ankle.

Exposure to cannabis and its main psychoactive ingredient, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), during adolescence may have long-lasting effects on the development of behavioral and neurobiological processes. This study investigated the effects of chronic adolescent exposure to THC on sensitization to the psychomotor-stimulating effects of cocaine and on the reinforcing effects of cocaine in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. During adolescence (P28-P45), rats were given once-daily intraperitoneal injections of either vehicle or 1 mg/kg THC. On P90, the acute locomotor-stimulating effects of cocaine and sensitization to cocaine were evaluated. Also, cocaine-maintained behavior was evaluated by determining within-session cocaine dose-effect curves, acquisition of behavior maintained by a small cocaine dose (0.1 mg/kg/infusion), and breakpoints on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. In general, there was no effect of adolescent THC exposure on the locomotor-stimulating effects of cocaine following acute or repeated administration. However, the reinforcing effects of cocaine were potentiated in rats treated with THC during adolescence, but this effect was only observed with small doses of cocaine. Rats exposed to THC during adolescence also more rapidly acquired self-administration behavior when a small cocaine dose was available. Together, these results demonstrate that exposure to THC during adolescence may enhance sensitivity to cocaine and/or enhance the reinforcing effects of cocaine even into adulthood under certain conditions. In conclusion, frequent exposure to THC during adolescence may produce long-lasting changes in behavior, possibly increasing susceptibility to addiction.

Our recent neurophysiological findings provided empirical evidence that the rostral lumbar spinal cord segments play a critical role in the initiation and generation of the rhythmic activation patterns necessary for hindlimb locomotion in adult spinal rats. Since added epidural stimulation at the S1 segments significantly enhanced the motor output generated by L2 stimulation, these data also suggested that the sacral spinal cord provides a strong facilitory influence in rhythm initiation and generation. However, whether L2 will initiate hindlimb locomotion in the absence of S1 segments, and whether S1 segments can facilitate locomotion in the absence of L2 segments remain unknown. Herein, adult rats received complete spinal cord transections at T8 and then at either L2 or S1. Rats with spinal cord transections at T8 and S1 remained capable of generating coordinated hindlimb locomotion when receiving epidural stimulation at L2 and when ensembles of locomotor related loadbearing input were present. In contrast, minimal locomotion was observed when S1 stimulation was delivered after spinal cord transections at T8 and L2. Results were similar when the nonspecific serotonergic agonists were administered. These results demonstrate in adult rats that rostral lumbar segments are essential for the regulation of hindlimb locomotor rhythmicity. In addition, the more caudal spinal networks alone cannot control locomotion in the absence of the rostral segments around L2 even when loadbearing rhythmic proprioceptive afferent input is imposed.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> The exact location of the spinal neuronal locomotor-related networks in adult mammals remains unknown. The present data demonstrate that when the rostral lumbar spinal segments (~L2) are completely eliminated in thoracic spinal adult rats, hindlimb stepping is not possible with neurochemical modulation of the lumbosacral cord. In contrast, eliminating the sacral cord retains stepping ability. These observations highlight the importance of rostral lumbar segments in generating effective mammalian locomotion.",

Mitochondrial respiration and ROS production show rhythmic activity. Mitochondrial carriers, which are responsible for mitochondrial substance transfer, are vital for mitochondrial metabolism. Clock (Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput) is the first core circadian gene identified in mammalian animals. However, whether CLOCK protein can regulate mitochondrial functions via mitochondrial carriers is unclear. Here, we showed that CLOCK can bind to the mitochondrial carrier SLC25A10. For further analysis, we established a Slc25a10<sup>-/-</sup>-Hepa1-6 cell line using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology. Slc25a10<sup>-/-</sup>-Hepa1-6 cells showed disordered glucose homeostasis, increased oxidative stress levels, and damaged electron transport chains. Next, using an immunoprecipitation assay, we found that amino acids 43-84 and 169-210 in SLC25A10 are key sites that respond to CLOCK binding. Finally, forced expression of wild-type SLC25A10 in Slc25a10<sup>-/-</sup>-Hepa1-6 cells could compensate for the loss of SLC25A10; the decreased glucose metabolism, severe oxidative stress and damaged electron transport chain were recovered. In addition, a mutant Slc25a10 with changes in two key sites did not show a rescue effect. In conclusion, we identified a new protein-protein interaction mechanism in which CLOCK can directly regulate cell metabolism via the mitochondrial membrane transporter SLC25A10. Our study might provide some new insights into the relationship between circadian clock and mitochondrial metabolism.",

There have been ample choices of phenomenological constitutive laws derived from experiments, some of which are quite sophisticated and include effects of microscopic fibre structures of the myocardium. A typical example is the strain-invariant-based Holzapfel-Ogden 2009 model that is excellently fitted to simple shear tests. It has been widely used and regarded as the state-of-the-art constitutive law for myocardium. However, there has been no analysis to show if it has both adequate descriptive and predictive capabilities for other tissue tests of myocardium. Indeed, such an analysis is important for any constitutive laws for clinically useful computational simulations. In this work, we perform such an analysis using combinations of tissue tests, uniaxial tension, biaxial tension and simple shear from three different sets of myocardial tissue studies. Starting from the general 14-parameter myocardial constitutive law developed by Holzapfel and Ogden, denoted as the general HO model, we show that this model has good descriptive and predictive capabilities for all the experimental tests. However, to reliably determine all 14 parameters of the model from experiments remains a great challenge. Our aim is to reduce the constitutive law using Akaike information criterion, to maintain its mechanical integrity whilst achieving minimal computational cost. A competent constitutive law should have descriptive and predictive capabilities for different tissue tests. By competent, we mean the model has least terms but is still able to describe and predict experimental data. We also investigate the optimal combinations of tissue tests for a given constitutive model. For example, our results show that using one of the reduced HO models, one may need just one shear response (along normal-fibre direction) and one biaxial stretch (ratio of 1 mean fibre : 1 cross-fibre) to satisfactorily describe Sommer et al. human myocardial mechanical properties. Our study suggests that single-state tests (i.e. simple shear or stretching only) are insufficient to determine the myocardium responses. We also found it is important to consider transmural fibre rotations within each myocardial sample of tests during the fitting process. This is done by excluding un-stretched fibres using an ""effective fibre ratio"", which depends on the sample size, shape, local myofibre architecture and loading conditions. We conclude that a competent myocardium material model can be obtained from the general HO model using AIC analysis and a suitable combination of tissue tests.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of 5-minute (mild), 15-minute (severe), and 20-minute (lethal) transient ischemia by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) on behavioral change and neuronal death and gliosis (astrocytosis and microgliosis) in gerbil hippocampal subregions (CA1-3 region and dentate gyrus). We performed spontaneous motor activity test to evaluate gerbil locomotor activity, cresyl violet staining to detect cellular distribution, neuronal nuclei immunohistochemistry to detect neuronal distribution, and Fluoro-Jade B histofluorescence to evaluate neuronal death. We also conducted immunohistochemical staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) to evaluate astrocytosis and microgliosis, respectively. Animals subjected to 20-minute BCCAO died in at least 2 days.

Also, biomechanical features are gaining much more attention. These features can be used as biomarkers which influence cancer progression. Current approaches on cancer treatment are mainly focused on changing the biochemical signaling of cancer cells, whereas less attention was devoted to their biomechanical properties. Herein, we propose targeting of cancer cell mechanics through the microenvironmental mechanical and chemical cues. As such, we examined the role of substrate stiffness as well as the effect of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) blockade in the cell mechanics. As a mechanical stimulus, stiff and soft polydimethylsiloxane substrates were utilized, while as a chemical stimulus, EGFR blockade was considered. Thus, breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, were cultured among chemical and mechanical groups. The local elasticity of cancer cells was assessed by atomic force microscopy nanoindentation method. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of mentioned mechanical and chemical treatments on the morphology, actin cytoskeleton structures, and cancer cell migration abilities. The stiffness and migration ability of cancer cells increased by substrate stiffening while Cetuximab treatment demonstrated an elevation in the elastic modulus of cells followed by a reduction in the migration ability. These findings indicate that cancer cell mechanics is modulated not only by the mechanical cues but also by the chemical ones through EGFR signaling pathway. Overall, our results illustrate that manipulation of cell mechanics allows for the possible modulation of tumor cell migration. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Furthermore, loss of δ-catenin is related to the deficits of learning and memory, mental retardation (cri-du-chat syndrome), and autism. A few studies about δ-catenin deficiency mice were performed. However, the effect of δ-catenin overexpression in the brain has not been investigated as yet. Therefore we generated a δ-catenin overexpressing mouse model. To generate a transgenic mouse model overexpressing δ-catenin in the brain, δ-catenin plasmid having a Thy-1 promotor was microinjected in C57BL/6 mice. Our results showed δ-catenin transgenic mice expressed higher levels of N-cadherin, β-catenin, and p120-catenin than did wild type mice. Furthermore, δ-catenin transgenic mice exhibited better object recognition, better sociability, and lower anxiety than wild type mice. However, both mice groups showed a similar pattern in locomotion tests. Although δ-catenin transgenic mice show similar locomotion, they show improved sociability and reduced anxiety. These characteristics are opposite to the symptoms of autism or mental retardation, which are caused when δ-catenin is deficient.

The robot mainly consists of two vacuum-actuated spring actuators and two electrostatic actuators. By programming the actuation sequences of different actuators, the robot is able to achieve two basic modes of locomotion: linear motion and turning. Subsequently, we have developed analytical models to interpret the static actuation performance of the robot body, including linear and bending motions. Moreover, an empirical dynamic model is also developed to optimize the locomotion speed in terms of frequency and duty cycle of the actuation signal. Furthermore, with the help of the strong electroadhesion force and fast response of the deformable body, the soft robot achieves a turning speed of 15.09°/s, which is one of the fastest among existing soft crawling robots to the best of our knowledge. In addition to the rapid and effective locomotion, the soft crawling robot can also achieve multiple impressive functions, including obstacle navigation in confined spaces, climbing a vertical wall with a speed of 6.67 mm/s (0.049 body length/s), carrying a payload of 69 times its self-weight on a horizontal surface, crossing over a 2 cm (0.15 body length) gap, and kicking a ball.",

While fracture fixation using metallic plates is a feasible treatment modality, the excessive stiffness of these devices produces the underloading of the bone which may result in the adverse bone remodelling and complications in the healing of the fracture. In this study, we investigated bisphenol A glycidylmethacrylate -based glass fibre reinforced composites as potential alternatives to metals in the devices intended for the fracture fixation of the distal radius in toy-breed dogs. Four composites with different glass fibre reinforcements were prepared as rectangular specimens and as fracture fixation plates. These were mechanically tested in three-point and four-point bending. There were two controls: polyether etherketone reinforced with short carbon fibres (specimens and plates) and commercially available stainless-steel plates. Finite element simulations were used for the assessment of the behaviour of the plates. For the control stainless steel plate, the bending strength was 1.358 N*m, superior to that of any of the composite plates. The composite plate with the matrix reinforced with continuous unidirectional glass fibres had the bending strength of 1.081 N*m, which is sufficient in this clinical context. For the plates made of polyether etherketone reinforced with carbon fibres, the strength was 0.280 N*m. Similar conclusions on the biomechanical behaviour of the plates could be made solely based on the results of the finite element simulations, provided the geometries and the material properties are well defined.",

The aim of this study was to ascertain whether shelter dogs do the same with their caregivers. We documented the behavior of 30 shelter dogs when they were taken outside in their regular walking area by their principal caregivers. The caregivers were instructed to behave in three ways: stay still, walk normally, and walk fast. The shelter dogs synchronized their locomotor activity with their caregiver less strongly than did pet dogs in a previous study. Shelter dogs also maintained greater distances to their caregivers than pet dogs with their owners. The present study predicts that the strength of the social bond between the caregiver and the dog explains most of the findings, which are similar to those found between adult human interacting partners. Further research could disentangle what aspects of experience contribute to the differences between pet dogs and shelter dogs in behavioral synchronization with a familiar human.

This behavior is most pronounced in monotonic but persists in cyclic tests. The dehydration associated with volume loss depends on the osmolarity of the environment, so that tension relaxation changes as a consequence of modifying the ionic strength of the environmental bath.

Developing suitable animal models and validating the therapeutic interventions in these models is the prerequisite for SCI repair improvement. Non-human primates, closer to humans than other species, are considered to be ideal models for translating laboratory discoveries into human clinical trials. In this study, the acute thoracic (T9) complete transection model in rhesus monkeys was established to evaluate the effects of linear-ordered collagen scaffold (LOCS) and LOCS combined with collagen binding neurotrophin-3 (CBD-NT3), which has been demonstrated to promote axonal regrowth and functional restoration in rodent models. After 10 months post-surgery, the grafted groups dramatically reduced cystic cavity formation and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) deposition and facilitated the ingrowth of axonal fibers at the lesion site. Further, the grafted groups displayed more regenerated fibers, exhibiting remyelination and synapse formation. Notably, the LOCS+CBD-NT3 group showed significant locomotor and electrophysiological recovery compared with the Control and LOCS groups. Therefore, LOCS+CBD-NT3 transplantation represents an effective strategy to promote spinal cord repair in non-human primates. More importantly, this complete transection model in non-human primate will contribute to effectively evaluating the potential interventions and accelerating clinical transformation in the future.",

The efficacies of current therapeutic interventions are still far from satisfaction as the secondary damages resulting from the complex and progressive molecular alterations after SCI are not properly addressed. Recent studies revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are abundant in the brain and might play critical roles in several nervous system disorders. At the cellular level, lncRNAs have been shown to regulate the expression of protein-coding RNAs and hence participate in neuronal death, demyelination and glia activation. Notably, SCI is characterized by these biological processes, suggesting that lncRNAs could be novel modulators in the pathogenesis of SCI. This review describes recent progresses in the lncRNA transcriptome analyses and their molecular functions in regulating SCI progression.",

In this study, both touch responses and neuron membrane potential were found to be abnormal in AgNPs-stressed embryos. Moreover, neurogenesis genes were unveiled to be down-regulated and were enriched in ligand-gated ion channel activity, dopamine receptor signaling pathway, etc. in AgNPs-stressed embryos by microarray assays. Additionally, the down-regulated expression of otpa/sncgb - gad1b/gad2 dopaminergic neurotransmitter genes, robo2 - vim and glrbb synaptic transmission genes, and motor neuron genes isl1 &isl2a was further identified in both AgNPs- and Ag<sup>+</sup>-stressed embryos by qPCR, whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH), and by using specific promoter-derived GFP fluorescence transgenic zebrafish. Moreover, the reduced expression of gad1b, gad2, and isl1 could be recovered by adding Ag<sup>+</sup> chelating compound l-cysteine in AgNPs stressed embryos.

It was observed in the experiments that cells, such as fibroblast, leukocytes, and cancer cells, exhibit a wide variety of migratory behaviors, such as persistent random walk, contact inhibition of locomotion, and ordered behaviors. To identify biophysical mechanisms for these cellular behaviors, we developed a rigorous computational model of cell migration on a two-dimensional non-deformable substrate. Cells in the model undergo motion driven by mechanical interactions between cellular protrusions and the substrate via the balance of tensile forces. Properties of dynamic formation of lamellipodia induced the persistent random walk behavior of a migrating cell. When multiple cells are included in the simulation, the model recapitulated the contact inhibition of locomotion between cells at low density without any phenomenological assumptions or momentum transfer. Instead, the model showed that contact inhibition of locomotion can emerge via indirect interactions between the cells through their interactions with the underlying substrate. At high density, contact inhibition of locomotion between numerous cells gave rise to confined motions or ordered behaviors, depending on cell density and how likely lamellipodia turn over due to contact with other cells. Results in our study suggest that various collective migratory behaviors may emerge without more restrictive assumptions or direct cell-to-cell biomechanical interactions.",

In this study, biomechanics of suspended and adhered breast cancer cells were investigated via the micropipette aspiration method with special emphasis on comparing the cell stiffness and viscoelastic parameters of estrogen receptor positive, ER+, MCF-7 and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive, HER2 +, SKBR-3 cancer cell lines prior to and post treatment with tamoxifen and trastuzumab, respectively. Alterations of mechanical parameters included significant increase in cell stiffness, especially after treatment with trastuzumab and changes in viscoelastic parameters, in both cancer cell lines post treatment. According to immunofluorescence analysis, the raised cell stiffness was corresponded to remodeling of F-actin, which peripherally located in tamoxifen treated and perinuclear accumulated in trastuzumab treated cancer cell cytoskeleton, implying a reduced potential for cell deformation and motility. Additionally, these results were in line with the study of single and collective cell migration through Boyden chamber and wound healing assays respectively, where the potential for migration was significantly decreased after treatment. Consequently, these findings lead to an increased interest in biomechanics of cancer progression after treatment with anti-tumor agents, importantly in understanding the effect of the alterations of mechanical properties upon the possibility for change in metastatic potential.",

This study examined potential abuse-related and adverse physiological effects of D -MA and L -MA alone and in combination in rats, as these effects had not been previously characterized. Potential abuse-related effects were examined in locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference paradigms. Body temperature was monitored to assess the physiological effects of these drugs or drug combinations. In the locomotor study, D-MA induced locomotor sensitization to both D-MA and L -MA. L -MA induced locomotor sensitization only to D-MA. Responses to a combination of L-MA and D -MA were not differentially affected by L-MA or D-MA conditioning. In the conditioned place preference study, D-MA and L -MA each induced significant place preference. L -MA did not attenuate D-MA-induced place preference. In the body temperature study, D-MA induced hyperthermia and L -MA induced hypothermia. In combination, L -MA did not affect D-MA-induced hyperthermia. These data suggest that L -MA alone produces less abuse-related and adverse physiological effects than D-MA, but modulates and is modulated by concurrent and subsequent D-MA exposure, which may enhance the abuse liability of both drugs. These findings should be considered when L -MA is proposed for replacement therapy.",

These 24-hour oscillations are necessary to optimize cellular functions and to synchronize these processes with the environment. Breast cancer patients and survivors frequently report disruptions in circadian oscillations that adversely affect quality-of-life, including fragmented sleep-wake cycles and flattened cortisol rhythms, which are associated with negative behavioral comorbidities (e.g., fatigue). However, the potential causal role of tumor biology in circadian dysregulation has not been investigated. Here, we examined the extent to which sham surgery, non-metastatic mammary tumors, or mammary tumor removal in mice disrupts circadian rhythms in brain clock gene expression, locomotor behavior (free-running and entrained), and physiological rhythms that have been associated with cancer behavioral comorbidities. Tumors and tumor resection altered time-of-day differences in hypothalamic expression of eight circadian-regulated genes. The onset of activity in entrained running behavior was advanced in tumor-bearing mice, and the amplitude of free-running rhythms was increased in tumor-resected mice. Tumors flattened rhythms in circulating corticosterone and Ly6c<sup>Hi</sup> monocytes which were largely restored by surgical tumor resection. This work implies that tumors alone may directly impact central and/or peripheral circadian rhythmicity in breast cancer patients, and that these effects may persist in cancer survivors, potentially contributing to behavioral comorbidities.",

PDAC includes a fibrous-like stroma, desmoplasia, encompassing most of the tumor mass, which is produced by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and includes their cell-derived extracellular matrices (CDMs). Since elimination of desmoplasia has proven detrimental to patients, CDM reprogramming, as opposed to stromal ablation, is therapeutically desirable. Hence, efforts are being made to harness desmoplasia's anti-tumor functions. We conducted biomechanical manipulations, using variations of pathological and physiological substrates in vitro, to culture patient-harvested CAFs and generate CDMs that restrict PDAC growth and spread. We posited that extrinsic modulation of the environment, via substrate rigidity, influences CAF's cell-intrinsic forces affecting CDM production. Substrates used were polyacrylamide gels of physiological (~1.5 kPa) or pathological (~7 kPa) stiffnesses. Results showed that physiological substrates influenced CAFs to generate CDMs similar to normal/control fibroblasts. We found CDMs to be softer than the corresponding underlying substrates, and CDM fiber anisotropy (i.e., alignment) to be biphasic and informed via substrate-imparted morphological CAF aspect ratios. The biphasic nature of CDM fiber anisotropy was mathematically modeled and proposed a correlation between CAF aspect ratios and CDM alignment; regulated by extrinsic and intrinsic forces to conserve minimal free energy. Biomechanical manipulation of CDMs, generated on physiologically soft substrates, leads to reduction in nuclear translocation of pERK1/2 in KRAS mutated pancreatic cells. ERK2 was found essential for CDM-regulated tumor cell spread. In vitro findings correlated with in vivo observations; nuclear pERK1/2 is significantly high in human PDAC samples. The study suggests that altering underlying substrates enable CAFs to remodel CDMs and restrict pancreatic cancer cell spread in an ERK2 dependent manner.",

Nevertheless, it is not clear whether these insects become active and leave their shelters on a daily basis, less frequently or, even fortnightly. Activity patterns were studied in Rhodnius prolixus Stål, 1859 (Hemiptera: Triatominae) associated with shelters to evaluate whether the decision to leave a shelter depends on bug starvation and the presence of host odours. Experiments were conducted with groups of 5th instar nymphs released in an experimental arena offering an artificial shelter consisting of a piece of corrugated cardboard positioned in its centre. Results indicate that host odours promoted a significant increase in shelter related activity, i.e. shelter-leaving or entering movements, and also in bug locomotion. This increase could only be observed with bugs starved for 30 or 60 days, but not for 21 days. Most R. prolixus nymphs that left shelters and engaged in locomotory activity were starved and in the presence of host odours. Even though R. prolixus is mostly considered a very active and ""aggressive"" triatomine, our results contradict this perspective and suggest that its main strategy regarding hosts is to wait and carefully evaluate feeding chances before becoming exposed. This behavioural strategy might have arisen through their evolution in palm trees in association with a diverse fauna that may impose predation risks.",

The antinociceptive potency and efficacy of THC (1.0-18 mg/kg ip) was compared in male and female rats aged postnatal day 35-40 (adolescent), 60-70 (young adult), and 291-325 (middle-aged adult), using warm water tail withdrawal and paw pressure tests. Motoric effects of THC were assessed using a locomotor activity test. On the tail withdrawal test, THC was significantly more effective in middle-aged adult than in young adult rats and significantly less effective in adolescent than in young adult rats. Similar but smaller age-related differences were observed on the paw pressure test. Sex differences in THC's antinociceptive effects were consistent across the 3 ages examined, with greater THC effects observed in females than males of each age. Age-related differences in THC's locomotor-suppressing effect were also observed, with the greatest effect in young adult female rats. Serum THC levels were slightly higher in adolescent than in young adult rats, and levels of the active metabolites 11-OH-THC and cannabinol, as well as the inactive metabolite 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC, did not differ between adolescent and young adult rats. These results suggest that the pain-relieving effects of THC may be more limited in adolescents than in adults and that these age-related differences in THC effect are not attributable to differential absorption or metabolism of THC.

The transient receptor vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a cation-permeable channel implicated in sensory transduction and pain signalling. Therefore, drugs that act on TRPV4 may have therapeutic applications to treat PDN. In the present work, we assessed the effect of the selective TRPV4 channel antagonist HC-067047 on painful neuropathy associated with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in mice. STZ-treated animals presented both mechanical and cold allodynia at 6 weeks after diabetes induction. Notably, HC-067047 (1 mg/kg, s.c.) given daily between 2 and 6 weeks after diabetes induction significantly prevented the development of mechanical allodynia. Additionally, both single and repeated treatments with HC-067047 (10 mg/kg, s.c.) significantly reverted established mechanical allodynia induced by STZ. However, HC-067047 was not capable of affecting either thermal cold allodynia or hyperglycemia. Similarly, HC-067047 treatments showed no effect on body weight, temperature, locomotor activity or motor coordination of control mice. Immunohistochemistry assay showed that TRPV4 expression was not different in sciatic nerve, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) or hind paw plantar skin from diabetic and non-diabetic mice, suggesting that HC-067047 acts on constitutive receptors to inhibit mechanical allodynia. Taken together, the data generated in the present study show the potential relevance of using TRPV4 antagonists to treat painful neuropathy associated with diabetes.",

These rhythms are entrained by stimuli that provide time of day cues (zeitgebers), such as light, which regulates the sleep-wake cycle and associated rhythms. But other events, including meals, social cues, and bouts of locomotor activity, can act as zeitgebers. Recent evidence shows that most organs and tissues contain cells that are capable of some degree of independent circadian cycling, suggesting the circadian system is broadly and diffusely distributed. Within laboratory studies of behavior, circadian rhythms tend to be treated as a complication to be minimized, but they offer a useful model of predictable shifts in behavioral tendencies. In the present review, we summarize the evidence that formed the basis for a hypothesis that drugs of abuse can entrain circadian rhythms and describe the outcome of a series of experiments designed to test that hypothesis. We propose that such drug-entrained rhythms may contribute to demonstrated daily variations in drug metabolism, tolerance, and sensitivity to drug reward. Of particular importance, these rhythms may be evoked by a single episode of drug taking, strengthen with repeated episodes, and re-emerge after long periods of abstinence, thereby contributing to drug abuse, addiction, and relapse.",

Pyraclostrobin at 36 μg/L or higher concentrations caused significant influences on larval heart and brain including pericardial edema, brain damage malformations, histological and mitochondrial structural damage of the two organs. The results of RNA-Seq revealed that the transcripts of genes related to oxidative phosphorylation, cardiac muscle contraction, mitochondrion, nervous system development and glutamate receptor activity were significantly influenced by 36 μg/L pyraclostrobin. Further tests showed that pyraclostrobin at 18 and 36 μg/L reduced the concentrations of proteins related to cardiac muscle contraction, impaired cardiac function, inhibited glutamate receptors activities and suppressed locomotor behavior of zebrafish larvae. Negative changes in mitochondrial complex activities, as well as reduced ATP content were also observed in larvae treated with 18 and 36 μg/L pyraclostrobin. These results suggested that pyraclostrobin exposure caused cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity in zebrafish larvae and mitochondrial dysfunction might be the underlying mechanism of pyraclostrobin toxicity.",

Several of these trophic factors have an effect at the neuronal level, such as BDNF. Consequently, recent reports have shown that exposure to these hormones (estrogen and progesterone) and trophic factors such as BDNF exert a neuroprotective effect. Here, we study the effect of the number of pregnancies on dendritic morphology of aged female rats (18 months of age). Rats of the 18-month-old Sprague Dawley strain with zero, one, two, and three gestations were evaluated for locomotor activity, and Golgi-Cox stain was performed to evaluate the dendritic morphology parameters, the number of dendritic spines, total dendritic length, and branching order number. Adult nulliparous rats (3 months of age) were used as another control group. Adult nulliparous and aging rats with two pregnancies showed an increase in locomotor activity. Adult nulliparous showed an increase in the dendritic spine number compared to old nulliparous rats in both layers of the PFC, the DG, and NAcc. Old rats with two and three pregnancies also showed an increase in the number of dendritic spines compared to old nulliparous rats in layers 3 and 5 of the PFC and in the CA1. Aging animals with one pregnancy also showed an increase in dendritic length compared to old nulliparous rats in the CA1. Our results clearly suggest that two and three pregnancies increase the dendritic spines number in the PFC and CA1 of aged female rats.",

NE gel was evaluated for pH, viscosity, in vitro/ex vivo permeation studies and in vivo anti-osteoporotic activity. The results indicated formation of spherical, nano sized globules of NE ranging from 11.17 ± 0.24 to 128.8 ± 0.16 nm with polydispersity of <0.5. In vitro and ex vivo permeation studies showed significantly higher permeation of NE as well as NE gel in comparison to fluvastatin solution indicating that NE gel can effectively penetrate through skin layers. In vivo anti-osteoporotic results demonstrated formation of new bone in trabecular region of osteoporotic rat femurs through micro-CT scanning radiographs. Biomechanical strength testing demonstrated greater load bearing capacity of rat femurs in the treated animals in comparison with the osteoporotic group.

While they most clearly manifest at the behavioral level, driving sleep-wake cycles, for example, they also provide critical temporal regulation at the level of individual tissues. Circadian clocks within organs act to ensure that each tissue is functioning in a coordinated manner to anticipate the needs of the organism as a whole but also allow for adaptation of organs to their local environment. One critical aspect of this environment is energy availability, which is communicated at the cellular level via changes in metabolites such as ATP, calcium, and NADH. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is both sensitive to fluctuations in secondary metabolites and capable of resetting the circadian clock via destabilization of the core clock components CRY and PER. Phosphorylation of serine 71 of CRY1 by AMPK destabilizes CRY1 by decreasing its interaction with binding partner PER2, thus enabling greater association with the SCF complex substrate adaptor FBXL3. Here, we describe a transgenic mouse harboring germline mutation of CRY1 serine 71 to alanine. Unexpectedly, this mutation does not affect the steady-state level of CRY1 protein in mouse livers or quadriceps. We also did not detect changes in either behavioral or molecular circadian rhythms, but female <i>Cry1</i><sup>S71A</sup> mice exhibit decreased voluntary locomotor activity compared with wild-type littermates. Together, these findings suggest that phosphorylation of CRY1 serine 71 is not required for the regulation of circadian rhythms under normal physiological conditions. However, it may be involved in responding to metabolic challenges or in other aspects of physiology that contribute to voluntary activity levels.",

The study aims to evaluate the eventual role of zinc (30 mg/Kg) in ameliorating clomipramine (75 mg/Kg) effects on behavior and oxidative stress equilibrium following a 6 day treatment in male Wistar rats. Our main findings showed that zinc improved clomipramine antidepressant and locomotor effects. Moreover, zinc reversed the oxidative stress induced by this drug in the liver. Thus, zinc at 30 mg/Kg may constitute an efficient adjuvant for clomipramine used at a high dose (75 mg/Kg) by boosting its efficacy on behavior and alleviating its negative effects on oxidative balance in liver.",

Animal studies have suggested initially some role of neurons as well as GABAergic and glutamatergic receptors of the zona incerta in locomotion and generation of PD signs. Anatomical data have indicated that thanks to its multiple interconnections with the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebral cortex, brainstem, spinal cord and cerebellum, the zona incerta is an important link in a neuronal chain transmitting impulses involved in PD pathology. Finally, clinical studies have shown that DBS of this structure alleviates parkinsonian bradykinesia, muscle rigidity and tremor.

An important objective of addiction research is to identify the brain changes that might mediate the transition from drug use to drug misuse. The persistent accumulation of the transcription factor, ∆FosB, following repeated drug exposure provides a means of achieving this objective. Experiments were conducted on sexually mature male Sprague-Dawley rats. The effects of extensive 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) self-administration on immunohistochemical measurements of ∆FosB accumulation in 12 brain regions was compared with a matched, drug-naive, control group. Other groups were pretreated with MDMA (0.0 or 10.0 mg/kg, ip, once daily for 5 days), and the locomotor-activating effect of MDMA (200 μg/side) microinjected bilaterally into brain regions selected on the basis of the ∆FosB results was subsequently determined. MDMA self-administration significantly increased ∆FosB expression in the nucleus accumbens core, ventromedial and dorsomedial caudate-putamen, anterior cingulate, prelimbic, infralimbic, and orbitofrontal cortex, and both the central and basolateral amygdala, but not in the ventrolateral or dorsolateral caudate-putamen. Increases in the nucleus accumbens shell were substantial but were not significant following statistical correction for multiple comparisons. MDMA pretreatment enhanced MDMA-produced hyperactivity only when administered into the nucleus accumbens or the medial, but not the lateral, caudate-putamen, mirroring the ∆FosB results. These data compare favorably to results following repeated exposure to other drugs of abuse and support the idea of common neuroplastic changes following repeated drug exposure.",

Dopamine receptor supersensitivity is developed in stimulant-induced CPP animals; however, dopamine receptor subtypes associated with the development of supersensitivity in CPP animals are largely unknown. The present preclinical study aimed to examine whether dopamine D1 or D2 receptor antagonists exert inhibitory effects on stimulant-induced psychological behaviors. Additionally, the authors aimed to elucidate the role of dopamine receptor supersensitivity on the development of reward-related behavior. Sprague Dawley rats subjected to methamphetamine- and cocaine-induced CPP tests were treated with dopamine D1 (SCH23390) or D2 (sulpiride) receptor antagonists. Following the CPP experiment, rats were challenged with apomorphine (dopamine receptor agonist), and locomotor activity was measured. Methamphetamine- and cocaine-induced CPP was reduced with the administration of SCH23390, but not sulpiride. In addition, the apomorphine challenge evoked an increase in locomotor activity in stimulant-pre-treated rats, reflecting dopamine receptor supersensitivity. SCH23390 pre-treatment inhibited the development of dopamine receptor supersensitivity, while sulpiride demonstrated no inhibitory effects. These results suggest that the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 inhibits the development of dopamine receptor supersensitivity which is associated with the development of CPP.",

Histamine H3 receptor (H3R) and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) are involved in several cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, anxiety, and narcolepsy, all of which are comorbid with ASD. Therefore, the present study aimed at evaluating effect of the novel dual-active ligand E100 with high H3R antagonist affinity and balanced AChE inhibition on autistic-like repetitive behavior, anxiety parameters, locomotor activity, and neuroinflammation in a mouse model of VPA-induced ASD in C57BL/6 mice. E100 (5, 10, and 15 mg/kg) dose-dependently and significantly ameliorated repetitive and compulsive behaviors by reducing the increased percentages of nestlets shredded (all P < 0.05). Moreover, pretreatment with E100 (10 and 15 mg/kg) attenuated disturbed anxiety levels (P < 0.05) but failed to restore the hyperactivity observed in the elevated open field test. Furthermore, pretreatment with E100 (10 mg/kg) mitigated the increase in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and expression of NF-κB, iNOS, and COX-2 in the cerebellum as well as the hippocampus (all P < 0.05). These results demonstrate the ameliorative effects of E100 on repetitive compulsive behaviors in a mouse model of ASD. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo demonstration of the effectiveness of a potent dual-active H3R antagonist and AChE inhibitor against autistic-like repetitive compulsive behaviors and neuroinflammation, and provides evidence for the role of such compounds in treating ASD.",

Considering the similar NMDAR activity of ketamine and d-methadone and the rapid and robust antidepressant effects of ketamine, we compared these 2 drugs in the forced swim test in Sprague-Dawley rats, which has been shown to be predictive of antidepressant activity for drugs with different mechanisms of action including ketamine. This study evaluated the antidepressant-like effect of d-methadone (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) in the forced swim test 24 hr following a single-dose administration. At all doses, d-methadone significantly (p < .05) decreased immobility of rats compared with vehicle, suggesting antidepressant-like activity. In addition, the effect of d-methadone (20 and 40 mg/kg) on immobility was greater than the effect seen with ketamine (10 mg/kg). Importantly, there were no changes in locomotor activity of rats that could have confounded the immobility effects at all doses (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) of d-methadone. This is the first demonstration that the NMDAR antagonist, d-methadone, exerts antidepressant-like activity in a preclinical animal model and that its efficacy is similar to or even stronger than that of ketamine, an antidepressant that demonstrates a rapid onset activity and robust efficacy in patients with treatment-resistant depression. d-Methadone is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2a clinical study for patients with treatment-resistant depression and could potentially represent a new effective antidepressant in the growing class of NMDAR antagonists.

Previously, we have found that gestational exposure to the complex mixture of tobacco smoke extract caused long-term neurobehavioral impairments. In this study, we examined the interaction of two of the most biologically active, nicotine and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP). Developmental effects were determined in Sprague-Dawley rats prenatally exposed to low doses of BaP and nicotine (0.03 mg/kg/day of BaP and 2 mg/kg/day of nicotine) via maternal osmotic minipumps throughout gestation. Behavioral function was assessed in the offspring via a battery of tests through adolescence into adulthood. There were sex-selective effects in four of the behavioral tests. In the elevated plus maze, there was a significant interaction of BaP and sex, where BaP-treated males showed a trend for increased activity. In the novelty suppressed feeding test, there were significant sex selective effects in males such that the normal sex difference in the behavior in this test was eliminated. Male offspring with prenatal exposure to either nicotine or BaP showed significant reductions in fear response. In the Figure-8 locomotor activity test, BAP-exposed male offspring were significantly hyperactive. This also eliminated the sex difference typically seen in this test. This effect persisted into adulthood. In the attention task, males exposed to nicotine during gestation showed a significant percent hit impairment. BaP reversed this effect. No significant effects were seen with percent correct rejection. These data show that both nicotine and BaP cause persisting sex-selective behavioral effects that persist into adulthood.",

The present study tested the hypothesis that empathy occurs in adult rats subjected to an experimental neurological disorder, by allowing co-experience of stroke with cagemates. Psychological stress was measured by general locomotor activity, Rat Grimace Scale (RGS), and plasma corticosterone. Physiological correlates were measured by Western blot analysis of advanced glycation endproducts (AGE)-related proteins in the thymus. General locomotor activity was impaired in stroke animals and in non-stroke rats housed with stroke rats suggesting transfer of behavioral manifestation of psychological stress from an injured animal to a non-injured animal leading to social inhibition. RGS was higher in stroke rats regardless of social settings. Plasma corticosterone levels at day 3 after stroke were significantly higher in stroke animals housed with stroke rats, but not with non-stroke rats, indicating that empathy upregulated physiological stress level. The expression of five proteins related to AGE in the thymus reflected the observed pattern of general locomotor activity, RGS, and plasma corticosterone levels. These results indicate that stroke-induced psychological stress manifested on both the behavioral and physiological levels and appeared to be affected by empathy-associated social settings.",

Evidence from human and animal studies has suggested that oxidative damage critically contributes to neuronal loss in PD. Carvacrol (CAR), a monoterpenic phenol, is the main constituents in the essential oil of many aromatic plants and possesses some properties including anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects. In this study, in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed with the CAR in order to investigate its potential neuroprotective effects in models of PD. Post-treatment with CAR in vitro was found to protect rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells from toxicity induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) administration in a dose-dependent manner by (1) increasing cell viability and (2) reduction in intracellular reactive oxygen species, intracellular lipid peroxidation, and annexin-positive cells. In vivo, post-treatment with CAR (15 and 20 mg/kg) was protective against neurodegenerative phenotypes associated with systemic administration of 6-OHDA. Results indicated that CAR improved the locomotor activity, catalepsy, akinesia, bradykinesia, and motor coordination and reduced the apomorphine-caused rotation in 6-OHDA-stimulated rats. Increased level of reduced glutathione content and a decreased level of MDA (malondialdehyde) were observed in the 6-OHDA rats post-treated with CAR. These findings suggest that CAR exerts protective effects, possibly related to an anti-oxidation mechanism, in these in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinson's disease.",

Melatonin (MT), a hormone secreted mainly by the pineal gland, is associated with neuroprotective effects against SCI. Enhanced autophagy can promote the recovery of locomotor function and reduce apoptosis after SCI. Interestingly, MT increases autophagy in SCI in vivo. Nevertheless, the ability of MT to increase autophagy and decrease apoptosis, and the potential effects on the recovery of motor neurons in the anterior horn after SCI remain to be clarified. In this study, we discovered that MT treatment improved motor function recovery in a rat SCI model. Indeed, MT upregulated the expression of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), while expression of protein kinase B (AKT) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was downregulated after SCI. Additionally, MT increased the expression of autophagy-activating proteins, while the expression of apoptosis-activating proteins in neurons was decreased following SCI. Furthermore, autophagy was inhibited, while apoptosis was induced in SCI model rats and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated primary neurons by treatment with MT, the PI3K inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin (Rapa). Collectively, our results suggest that MT can improve the recovery of locomotor function by enhancing autophagy as well as reducing apoptosis after SCI in rats, probably via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.",

On the one hand, ovarian hormones may have beneficial effects on several neurophysiological processes, including memory. On the other hand, chronic exposure to stressful conditions has negative effects on brain structures related to learning and memory. In the present study, we used the plus-maze discriminative avoidance task (PMDAT) to evaluate the influence of endogenous variations of sex hormones and exposure to different types of prolonged stressors on learning, memory, anxiety-like behavior and locomotion. Female Wistar rats were submitted to seven consecutive days of restraint stress (4 h/day), overcrowding (18 h/day) or social isolation (18 h/day) and tested in different phases of the estrous cycle. The main results showed that: (1) neither stress conditions nor estrous cycle modified PMDAT acquisition; (2) restraint stress and social isolation induced memory impairments; (3) this impairment was observed particularly in females in metestrus/diestrus; (4) stressed females in estrus displayed less risk assessment behavior, suggesting reduced anxiety-like behavior; (5) restraint stress and social isolation, but not overcrowding, elevated corticosterone levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that the phase of the estrous cycle is an important modulatory factor of the cognitive processing disrupted by stress in female rats. Negative effects were observed in metestrus/diestrus, indicating that the peak of sex hormones may protect females against stress-induced memory impairment.",

Very little attention has been paid to understand the combined effects of both the vitamins during pregnancy. The present study was designed to evaluate the biochemical and behavioral outcomes following alterations in folate and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels in C57BL/6 mice. The female mice were fed with different combinations of folate and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> whereas; males were fed with normal diet for 4 weeks. The mice were mated and the pregnant mice received the same diets as before pregnancy. The F1 male mice were further continued on maternal diet for 6 weeks following neurobehavioral and biochemical assessment. The body weight of the F1 male mice was significantly decreased in the mice that received folate and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient diet. Altered cognitive functions were observed in the folate and B<sub>12</sub> deficient F1 male mice as assessed by Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests. Spontaneous locomotor activity was decreased in F1 male mice fed with folate and B<sub>12</sub> deficient diets. Elevated homocysteine levels and decreased hydrogen sulfide levels were also observed in the brain of F1 male mice on folate and B<sub>12</sub> deficient diets. However, GSH and GSSG levels were increased in the brain of the animals supplemented with folate deficient diet with different combinations of B<sub>12</sub>. The study suggests that exposure of female mice to folate and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency during pregnancy effects in-utero development of fetus, which further leads to behavioral anomalies in adult life and is sufficient to cause impaired cognitive behavior in the subsequent generation. Thus, elucidating the role and importance of maternal dietary folate and B<sub>12</sub> ratio during pregnancy.",

Our study provides the first whole brain analysis of cerebral activation during retrieval of spatial memory in the freely-moving rat. Rats (LEARNERS) were trained in the Barnes maze, an allocentric spatial navigation task, while CONTROLS received passive exposure. After 19 days, functional brain mapping was performed during recall by bolus intravenous injection of [<sup>14</sup>C]-iodoantipyrine using a novel subcutaneous minipump triggered by remote activation. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF)-related tissue radioactivity was analyzed by statistical parametric mapping from autoradiographic images of the three-dimensionally reconstructed brains. Functional connectivity was examined between regions of the spatial navigation circuit through interregional correlation analysis. Significant rCBF increases were noted in LEARNERS compared to CONTROLS broadly across the spatial navigation circuit, including the hippocampus (anterior dorsal CA1, posterior ventral CA1-3), subiculum, thalamus, striatum, medial septum, cerebral cortex, with decreases noted in the mammillary nucleus, amygdala and insula. LEARNERS showed a significantly greater positive correlation of rCBF of the ventral hippocampus with retrosplenial, lateral orbital, parietal and primary visual cortex, and a significantly more negative correlation with the mammillary nucleus, amygdala, posterior entorhinal cortex, and anterior thalamic nucleus. The complex sensory component of the spatial navigation task was underscored by broad activation across visual, somatosensory, olfactory, auditory and vestibular circuits which was enhanced in LEARNERS. Brain mapping facilitated by an implantable minipump represents a powerful tool for evaluation of mammalian behaviors dependent on locomotion.",

Necroptosis is a regulated process of cell death triggered by RIPK1. Although the pathophysiology of PD has been studied extensively, the cellular mechanism underlying dopaminergic neuron death remains unclear. In this study, we detected a specific miRNA, miR-425, in response to MPTP toxicity and dopaminergic degeneration. In MPTP-treated mice, we observed necroptosis activation and miR-425 deficiency in the substantia nigra, which is correlated with dopaminergic neuron loss. This miRNA targeted RIPK1 transcripts and promoted the phosphorylation of MLKL and necroptosis. Similarly, in the brains of PD patients, miR-425 deficiency and necroptosis activation were also confirmed in dopaminergic neuron. Furthermore, we found that genetic knockdown of miR-425 aggravated MPTP-induced motor deficits and dopaminergic neurodegeneration via early upregulation of necroptotic genes. Intracerebral miR-425 mimics (AgomiR-425) treatment attenuated necroptosis activation and dopaminergic neuron loss, and improved locomotor behaviors. In conclusion, our study suggests that miR-425 deficiency triggers necroptosis of dopaminergic neurons, and targeting miR-425 in MPTP-treated mice restored dysfunctional dopaminergic neurodegeneration and ameliorated behavioral deficits. These findings identify brain delivery of miR-425 as a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of PD.",

Tramadol is a synthetic opioid analgesic used to treat chronic and acute pain. To investigate its long-term effects at environmentally relevant levels, we evaluated heart rate (HR) and locomotion of signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus during a 21-day exposure to 1 μg L-1 tramadol followed by 14 days depuration. Locomotion and HR were recorded over a period 30 min before and 30 min after exposure to physiological fluids of an injured conspecific, a natural stressor, four times during the tramadol exposure and four times during depuration. A significant increase in HR following stress induction was found in the majority of tramadol-exposed and control crayfish, as well as significant group-specific HR changes between both groups. Locomotor activity during tramadol treatment differed from that during depuration, in general showing less time spent in locomotion and lower distance moved. The tramadol exposed crayfish exhibited higher velocity during depuration than during the exposure period. Results may suggest a potential shift in prey-predator relationships.",

Two hundred Wistar rats were divided into four groups, two control groups, a vitamin sufficient control group and a vitamin deficiency control group and 2 test groups, a vitamin sufficient test group, and a vitamin deficiency group. The test groups were exposed for 9 months to a mixture of diquat, imazamox, imazethapyr, tepraloxydin, bentazone and acifluorfen in doses of 0.01xNOAEL (mg/kg bw/day). After 9 months of exposure, the behavior changes were evaluated by open field test and elevated plus maze test and the memory was assessed by passive avoidance test. Chronic vitamin deficiency decreased locomotor and special orientation activity and increased anxiety-like behavior in rats. Exposure to very low doses of a mixture of 6 pesticides caused central nervous effects, manifested as decreased locomotor activity, and increased anxiety levels. Vitamin deficiency and low dose chronic pesticides mixture exposure thus affected the central nervous system, especially long-term memory.",

In particular, the CPGs control the activity of motoneuron (MN) pools which drive the muscles of the individual legs and are thereby responsible for the generation of rhythmic leg movements. The rhythmic activity of the CPGs as well as their connectivity can be modified by the aforementioned sensory signals. However, the precise nature of the interaction between the CPGs and these sensory signals has remained generally largely unknown. Experimental methods aiming at finding out details of these interactions often apply cholinergic agonists such as pilocarpine in order to induce rhythmic activity in the CPGs. Using this general approach, we removed the influence of sensory signals and investigated the putative connections between CPGs controlling the upward/downward movement in the different legs of the stick insect. The experimental data, i.e. the measured MN activities, underwent connectivity analysis using Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM). This method can uncover the underlying coupling structure and strength between pairs of segmental CPGs. For the analysis we set up different coupling schemes (models) for DCM and compared them using Bayesian Model Selection (BMS). Models with contralateral connections in each segment and ipsilateral connections on both sides, as well as the coupling from the meta- to the ipsilateral prothoracic ganglion were preferred by BMS to all other types of models tested. Moreover, the intrasegmental coupling strength in the mesothoracic ganglion was the strongest and most stable in all three ganglia.",

However, current neuronal interfaces hinder long-term studies in awake and freely behaving animals, as they are limited in their ability to provide simultaneous and prolonged delivery of multiple drugs, are often bulky and lack multifunctionality, and employ custom control systems with insufficiently versatile selectivity for output mode, animal selection and target brain circuits. Here, we describe smartphone-controlled, minimally invasive, soft optofluidic probes with replaceable plug-like drug cartridges for chronic in vivo pharmacology and optogenetics with selective manipulation of brain circuits. We demonstrate the use of the probes for the control of the locomotor activity of mice for over four weeks via programmable wireless drug delivery and photostimulation. Owing to their ability to deliver both drugs and photopharmacology into the brain repeatedly over long time periods, the probes may contribute to uncovering the basis of neuropsychiatric diseases.",

Therefore, finding new antioxidant sources might be beneficial for its treatment. Avocado Persea americana is a fruit widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical climates worldwide. Although avocado by-products in the form of peel, seed coat and seeds are currently of no commercial use, they constitute a natural source of bioactive compounds. Methanolic (80%) extract obtained from lyophilized ground peels, seed coats, and seeds of the avocado Hass, Fuerte, Reed and Colinred varieties were analyzed for their total phenolic content (TPC) and their correlations with antioxidant capacity (AC) were assessed by ABTS, FRAP, and ORAC assays. For all varieties, the var. Colinred peel shows the highest TPC and AC. Further analysis showed that the var. Colinred peel presented major phenolic compounds B-type procyanidins and epicatechin according to HPLC-MS. The antioxidant effect of peel extract was evaluated upon in vivo oxidative stress (OS) model. We show for the first time that the peel extract can protect and/or prevent transgenic parkinDrosophila melanogaster fly against paraquat-induced OS, movement impairment and lipid peroxidation, as model of PD.

This study utilized the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to decipher the toxic effects of early life exposure to DEHP on aging and its underlying mechanisms. The results showed that exposure to DEHP at 0.1 and 1.5 mg/L inhibited locomotive behaviors. In addition, DEHP exposure significantly shortened the mean lifespan of the worms and further adversely affected pharyngeal pumping rate and defecation cycle in aged worms. Moreover, DEHP exposure also further enhanced accumulation of age-related biomarkers including lipofuscin, lipid peroxidation, and intracellular reactive oxygen species in aged worms. In addition, exposure to DEHP significantly suppressed gene expression of hsp-16.1, hsp-16.49, and hsp-70 in aged worms. Further evidences showed that mutation of genes involved in insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS) pathway (daf-2, age-1, pdk-1, akt-1, akt-2, and daf-16) restored lipid peroxidation accumulation upon DEHP exposure in aged worms, whereas skn-1 mutation resulted in enhanced lipid peroxidation accumulation. Therefore, IIS and SKN-1 may serve as an important molecular basis for DEHP-induced age-related declines in C. elegans. Since IIS and SKN-1 are highly conserved among species, the age-related declines caused by DEHP exposure may not be exclusive in C. elegans, leading to adverse human health consequences due to widespread and persistent DEHP contamination in the environment.",

Modulation of synaptic morphology and function is often induced by signals from glia. However, the process by which glia mediate synaptic responses to environmental perturbations such as hypoxia remains unknown. Here, we report that, in the mutant for Trachealess (Trh), the Drosophila homolog for NPAS1 and NPAS3, smaller synaptic boutons form clusters named satellite boutons appear at larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), which is induced by the reduction of internal oxygen levels due to defective tracheal branches. Thus, the satellite bouton phenotype in the trh mutant is suppressed by hyperoxia, and recapitulated in wild-type larvae raised under hypoxia. We further show that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α/Similar (Sima) is critical in mediating hypoxia-induced satellite bouton formation. Sima upregulates the level of the Wnt/Wingless (Wg) signal in glia, leading to reorganized microtubule structures within presynaptic sites. Finally, hypoxia-induced satellite boutons maintain normal synaptic transmission at the NMJs, which is crucial for coordinated larval locomotion.",

However, the FCD decreases with IVD degeneration, reducing the disc propensity to swell and the related convective transport of molecules across the IVDs. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the FCD on water intake in the IVD during bed rest. A multibody musculoskeletal model was extended to include the osmotic properties of the IVDs, and used for the analysis of IVD swelling and its water content in a human subject during bed rest. The simulations were conducted with both healthy lumbar IVDs and lumbar IVDs with a reduced FCD. It was predicted that a decrease in the FCD had a considerable impact on the IVDs swelling during bed rest. A 20% and a 45% reduction in the FCD resulted respectively in an average 25% and 55% reduction of disc water intake overnight. This study provided an additional, quantitative information on IVD swelling in human subjects during bed rest.

Creation of disease models in experimental animals, specifically in minipigs, is controversial, as no appropriate technique has been reported. Methods Surgical costotransversectomy was performed in 11 minipigs using 3 different approaches: posterior medial approach (4 animals, group I), posterior paramedial approach (3 animals, group II) and anterior approach by videothoracoscopy (4 animals, group III). A conventional x-ray study was performed in the immediate postoperative period. Follow-up lasted for 4 months. Specimens were humanely killed according to current protocols, and a second x-ray study was performed. A deformation was measured using the Cobb angle and direct observation of the rotational component. Results Data from group I revealed a scoliosis deformation of 27º-41º (mean 34.5º) with a macroscopic rotational component. No deformity (<10º) or rotational component was observed in groups II and III. Only a posterior medial costotransversectomy produced a significant deformity in minipigs and established a valid model for studying scoliosis in these animals. Conclusion Only a posterior medial costotransversectomy produces a significant deformity in minipigs and establish a valid model for studying scoliosis in these animals. A tensegrity model would elucidate such results and harmonize disparate conclusions. Further investigation is needed to demonstrate the reliability of tensegrity principles for spinal biomechanics.",

The aim of this study was to assess the fatigue life of titanium (Ti) and cobalt-chrome (CoCr) rod-screw constructs after being treated with electrocautery. Twelve spinal constructs with CoCr and Ti rods were examined. Specimens were divided into four groups by rod material (Ti and CoCr) and application of monopolar electrocautery on the rods' surface (control-group and electrocautery-group). Electrocautery was applied on each rod at three locations, then constructs were cyclically tested. Outcome measures were load-to-failure, total number of cycles-to-failure, and location of rod failure. Ti-rods treated with electrocautery demonstrated a significantly decreased fatigue life compared to non-treated Ti-rods. Intergroup comparison of cycles-to-failure revealed a significant mean decrease of almost 9 × 10<sup>5</sup> cycles (<i>p</i> = 0.03). No CoCr-rods failed in this experiment.

In this work, damping capacity and dynamic Young's modulus of Y-TZP/porcelain composites for all-ceramic dental restorations were studied. These mechanical properties were assessed by dynamic mechanical analyses (DMA) at frequencies of 1, 5 and 10 Hz, over a temperature ranging from 0 to 60 °C, simulating extreme conditions when a cold or hot drink is experienced. The results showed that porcelain and porcelain-matrix composites exhibited higher damping capacity while Y-TZP and Y-TZP-matrix composites presented higher dynamic Young's modulus. Furthermore, while damping capacity is strongly influenced by the temperature, no significant difference in dynamic Young's modulus was found. For both damping and modulus properties, no significant influence of frequency was found for the tested materials. Based on the obtained results and also on the known advantages of the graded Y-TZP/porcelain structures over traditional bi-layer solutions (e.g., improved bending strength, enhanced mechanical and thermal stress distribution), a novel design of all-ceramic restoration with damping capacity has been proposed at the end of this study. A positive impact on the long-term performance of these all-ceramic restorations may be expected.",

The TBC1D24 protein consists of the unique association of a Tre2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC) domain and a TBC/lysin motif domain/catalytic (TLDc) domain. More than 50 missense and loss-of-function mutations have been described and are spread over the entire protein. Through whole genome/exome sequencing we identified compound heterozygous mutations, R360H and G501R, within the TLDc domain, in an index family with a Rolandic epilepsy exercise-induced dystonia phenotype (http://omim.org/entry/608105). A 20-year long clinical follow-up revealed that epilepsy was self-limited in all three affected patients, but exercise-induced dystonia persisted into adulthood in two. Furthermore, we identified three additional sporadic paediatric patients with a remarkably similar phenotype, two of whom had compound heterozygous mutations consisting of an in-frame deletion I81_K84 and an A500V mutation, and the third carried T182M and G511R missense mutations, overall revealing that all six patients harbour a missense mutation in the subdomain of TLDc between residues 500 and 511. We solved the crystal structure of the conserved Drosophila TLDc domain. This allowed us to predict destabilizing effects of the G501R and G511R mutations and, to a lesser degree, of R360H and potentially A500V. Next, we characterized the functional consequences of a strong and a weak TLDc mutation (TBC1D24G501R and TBC1D24R360H) using Drosophila, where TBC1D24/Skywalker regulates synaptic vesicle trafficking. In a Drosophila model neuronally expressing human TBC1D24, we demonstrated that the TBC1D24G501R TLDc mutation causes activity-induced locomotion and synaptic vesicle trafficking defects, while TBC1D24R360H is benign. The neuronal phenotypes of the TBC1D24G501R mutation are consistent with exacerbated oxidative stress sensitivity, which is rescued by treating TBC1D24G501R mutant animals with antioxidants N-acetylcysteine amide or α-tocopherol as indicated by restored synaptic vesicle trafficking levels and sustained behavioural activity. Our data thus show that mutations in the TLDc domain of TBC1D24 cause Rolandic-type focal motor epilepsy and exercise-induced dystonia. The humanized TBC1D24G501R fly model exhibits sustained activity and vesicle transport defects. We propose that the TBC1D24/Sky TLDc domain is a reactive oxygen species sensor mediating synaptic vesicle trafficking rates that, when dysfunctional, causes a movement disorder in patients and flies. The TLDc and TBC domain mutations' response to antioxidant treatment we observed in the animal model suggests a potential for combining antioxidant-based therapeutic approaches to TBC1D24-associated disorders with previously described lipid-altering strategies for TBC domain mutations.",

In this work we applied leachates from plastics fabricated using a stereolithography (SLA) process to early developmental stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity. Migration of unpolymerized photoinitiator, 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone (1-HCHPK) from a plastic solid phase to aqueous media at up to 200 mg/L in the first 24 h was detected using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Both plastic extracts (LC<sub>50</sub> 22.25% v/v) and 1-HCHPK (LC<sub>50</sub> 60 mg/L) induced mortality and teratogenicity within 48 h of exposure. Developmental toxicity correlated with in situ generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), an increase in lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation markers and enhanced activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in embryos exposed to concentrations as low as 20% v/v for plastic extracts and 16 mg/L for 1-HCHPK. ROS-induced cellular damage led to induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis which could be pharmacologically inhibited with both antioxidant ascorbic acid and a pan-caspase inhibitor. Neuro-behavioral analysis showed that exposure to plastic leachates reduced spontaneous embryonic movement in 24-36 hpf embryos. Plastic extracts in concentrations above 20% v/v induced rapid retardation of locomotion, changes in photomotor response and habituation to photic stimuli with progressive paralysis in 120 hpf larvae. Significantly decreased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity with lack of any CNS-specific apoptotic phenotypes as well as lack of changes in motor neuron density, axonal growth, muscle segment integrity or presence of myoseptal defects were detected upon exposure to plastic extracts during embryogenesis. Considering implications of the results for environmental risk assessment and the growing usage of 3D-printing technologies, we speculate that some 3D-printed plastic waste may represent a significant and yet very poorly uncharacterized environmental hazard that merits further investigation on a range of aquatic and terrestrial species.",

Series B, Biological sciences*",* [Ecological pressures and the contrasting scaling of metabolism and body shape in coexisting taxa: cephalopods versus teleost fish.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31203759),Ecological pressures and the contrasting scaling of metabolism and body shape in coexisting taxa: cephalopods versus teleost fish.,"Metabolic rates are fundamental to many biological processes, and commonly scale with body size with an exponent ( b<sub>R</sub>) between 2/3 and 1 for reasons still debated. According to the 'metabolic-level boundaries hypothesis', b<sub>R</sub> depends on the metabolic level ( L<sub>R</sub>). We test this prediction and show that across cephalopod species intraspecific b<sub>R</sub> correlates positively with not only L<sub>R</sub> but also the scaling of body surface area with body mass. Cephalopod species with high L<sub>R</sub> maintain near constant mass-specific metabolic rates, growth and probably inner-mantle surface area for exchange of respiratory gases or wastes throughout their lives. By contrast, teleost fish show a negative correlation between b<sub>R</sub> and L<sub>R</sub>. We hypothesize that this striking taxonomic difference arises because both resource supply and demand scale differently in fish and cephalopods, as a result of contrasting mortality and energetic pressures, likely related to different locomotion costs and predation pressure. Cephalopods with high L<sub>R</sub> exhibit relatively steep scaling of growth, locomotion, and resource-exchange surface area, made possible by body-shape shifting. We suggest that differences in lifestyle, growth and body shape with changing water depth may be useful for predicting contrasting metabolic scaling for coexisting animals of similar sizes.

It is important to study mechanically induced microstructural alterations in the tricuspid valve leaflets, as this aids both in understanding valvular diseases and in the development of new engineered tissue replacements. The structure and composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) fiber networks are closely tied to an overall biomechanical function of the tricuspid valve. In this study, we conducted experiments and implemented a multiscale modeling approach to predict ECM microstructural changes to tissue-level mechanical responses in a controlled loading environment. In particular, we characterized a sample of a porcine anterior leaflet at a macroscale using a biaxial mechanical testing method. We then generated a three-dimensional finite element model, to which computational representations of corresponding fiber networks were incorporated based on properties of the microstructural architecture obtained from small angle light scattering. Using five different biaxial boundary conditions, we performed iterative simulations to obtain model parameters with an overall R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.93. We observed that mechanical loading could markedly alter the underlying ECM architecture. For example, a relatively isotropic fiber network (with an anisotropy index value α of 28%) became noticeably more anisotropic (with an α of 40%) when it underwent mechanical loading. We also observed that the mechanical strain was distributed in a different manner at the ECM/fiber level as compared to the tissue level. The approach presented in this study has the potential to be implemented in pathophysiologically altered biomechanical and structural conditions and to bring insights into the mechanobiology of the tricuspid valve. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Quantifying abnormal cellar/ECM-level deformation of tricuspid valve leaflets subjected to a modified loading environment is of great importance, as it is believed to be linked to valvular remodeling responses. For example, developing surgical procedures or engineered tissue replacements that maintain/mimic ECM-level mechanical homeostasis could lead to more durable outcomes. To quantify leaflet deformation, we built a multiscale framework encompassing the contributions of disorganized ECM components and organized fibers, which can predict the behavior of the tricuspid valve leaflets under physiological loading conditions both at the tissue level and at the ECM level. In addition to future in-depth studies of tricuspid valve pathologies, our model can be used to characterize tissues in other valves of the heart.",

There are multiple surgical procedures. A biomechanical study was conducted to compare the stability of a compression wire to intraosseous wiring for the arthrodesis. Seventeen formalin-fixed human fingers were randomly assigned into two groups and the bone mineral density was determined. Arthrodesis in 20° flexion was performed using an oblique compression wire (n=8) or intraosseous wiring (n=9). The stability of the arthrodesis was tested by applying a tensile bending force until failure. The mean force needed to fail the compression wire arthrodesis and intraosseous wire arthrodesis was not significantly different (76.2 N, SD 31 N and 63.0 N, SD 28 N). There was no correlation between bone density and force to failure. The compression wire was within the approximate range achieved by intraosseous wiring in withstanding substantial force before failure. From a biomechanical point of view, a compression wire is feasible for PIP arthrodesis.",

These direct interactions serve as molecular initiating events that impede adenosine triphosphate production and other critical functions that mitochondria serve within the cell (e.g., calcium and metal homeostasis, apoptosis, immune signaling, redox balance). A limited but growing number of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) have been proposed to associate mitochondrial dysfunction with effects at organismal and population levels. These pathways involve key events such as altered membrane potential, mitochondrial fission/fusion, and mitochondrial DNA damage, among others. The present critical review and analysis reveals current progress on AOPs involving mitochondrial dysfunction, and, using a network-based computational approach, identifies the localization of mitochondrial molecular initiating events and key events within multiple existing AOPs. We also present 2 case studies, the first examining the interaction between mitochondria and immunotoxicity, and the second examining the role of early mitochondrial dysfunction in the context of behavior (i.e., locomotor activity). We discuss limitations in our current understanding of mitochondrial AOPs and highlight opportunities for clarifying their details. Advancing our knowledge of key event relationships within the AOP framework will require high-throughput datasets that permit the development and testing of chemical-agnostic AOPs, as well as high-resolution research that will enhance the mechanistic testing and validation of these key event relationships. Given the wide range of chemicals that affect mitochondria, and the centrality of energy production and signaling to ecologically important outcomes such as pathogen defense, homeostasis, growth, and reproduction, a better understanding of mitochondrial AOPs is expected to play a significant, if not central, role in environmental toxicology.

However, excessive Mn exposure leads to neurological complications. Although no precise mechanism(s) has been found for Mn-induced neurotoxicity, oxidative stress and mitochondrial injury seem to play a relevant role in this complication. On the other hand, there is no protective strategy against Mn neurotoxicity so far. Taurine is an amino acid with significant neuroprotective properties. The current study was designed to evaluate the effect of taurine supplementation and its potential mechanism(s) of action in a mouse model of manganism. Animals were treated with Mn (100 mg/kg, s.c) alone and/or in combination with taurine (50, 100, and 500 mg/kg, i.p, for eight consecutive days). Severe locomotor dysfunction along with a significant elevation in brain tissue biomarkers of oxidative stress was evident in Mn-exposed mice. On the other hand, it was revealed that mitochondrial indices of functionality were hampered in Mn-treated animals. Taurine supplementation (50, 100, and 500 mg/kg, i.p) alleviated Mn-induced locomotor deficit. Moreover, this amino acid mitigated oxidative stress biomarkers and preserved brain tissue mitochondrial indices of functionality. These data introduce taurine as a potential neuroprotective agent against Mn neurotoxicity. Antioxidative and mitochondria protecting effects of taurine might play a fundamental role in its neuroprotective properties against Mn toxicity.",

Nevertheless, guided bone regeneration which fulfills the criteria in terms of biomechanics, biodegradability and bioactivity is highly appealing but challenging. Inspired by the superior double-network (DN) structure, herein, a biodegradable hybrid DN hydrogel is proposed to promote in situ bone regeneration. The DN hydrogel is constructed by interspersing a methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) network into a well-defined nanocomposite (NC) hydrogel consisting of methacrylated chitosan (CSMA) and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) via a two-step photo-crosslinking process. The hybrid DN hydrogel has the following advantageous characteristics: (i) it exhibits enhanced stiffness and toughness benefiting from the inorganic POSS units and unique energy dissipation; (ii) naturally occurring biomacromolecules (chitosan and gelatin) as the hydrogel framework result in an appropriate biodegradation behavior, which can be replaced by newly formed tissues; (iii) it preferentially guides mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) toward osteogenic differentiation in vitro by detecting the elevated levels of enzyme activity and calcium deposition along with the up-regulated osteogenesis-related genes and proteins; and (iv) accelerated in situ bone regeneration is observed after implanting MSC-loaded hydrogels into rat calvarial defects. Therefore, we provide a new insight to develop functional hydrogels for triggering specific cellular responses toward stem cell therapy and bone-related tissue engineering.",

However, the effects of memantine on BPSD-like behaviors in animals have not been well addressed. Here, the effects of memantine on memory disturbance and BPSD-like behaviors were evaluated in thiamine-deficient (TD) mice. Memantine (3 and 10 mg/kg, b.i.d.) was orally administered to ddY mice fed a TD diet for 22 days. During the treatment period, the forced swimming test, elevated plus-maze test, passive avoidance test, and locomotor activity test were performed. Neurotransmitter levels in the brain were analyzed after the treatment period. Daily oral administration of memantine ameliorated the memory disturbances, anxiety-like behavior, and depression-like behavior observed in TD mice. Memantine did not have a significant effect on monoamine levels, but increased glutamate levels in the hippocampus in TD mice. These results suggest that memantine prevents or suppresses the progression of BPSD-like behaviors that develop due to TD. This effect may be mediated in part by the enhancement of glutamatergic neuron activity in the hippocampus.",

Disentangling the role of neutral versus adaptive processes in wing shape diversification remains a challenge for evolutionary biologists. Ascertaining how natural selection influences wing shape evolution requires both functional studies linking morphology to flight performance, and ecological investigations linking performance in the wild with fitness. However, direct links between morphological variation and fitness have rarely been established. The functional morphology of butterfly flight has been investigated but selective forces acting on flight behaviour and associated wing shape have received less attention. Here, we attempt to estimate the ecological relevance of morpho-functional links established through biomechanical studies in order to understand the evolution of butterfly wing morphology. We survey the evidence for natural and sexual selection driving wing shape evolution in butterflies, and discuss how our functional knowledge may allow identification of the selective forces involved, at both the macro- and micro-evolutionary scales. Our review shows that although correlations between wing shape variation and ecological factors have been established at the macro-evolutionary level, the underlying selective pressures often remain unclear. We identify the need to investigate flight behaviour in relevant ecological contexts to detect variation in fitness-related traits. Identifying the selective regime then should guide experimental studies towards the relevant estimates of flight performance. Habitat, predators and sex-specific behaviours are likely to be major selective forces acting on wing shape evolution in butterflies. Some striking cases of morphological divergence driven by contrasting ecology involve both wing and body morphology, indicating that their interactions should be included in future studies investigating co-evolution between morphology and flight behaviour.",

Most studies lack a multifactorial analysis of what causes breast implants to rupture. To fill this gap, an experimental protocol was developed to compare ruptured and intact Poly Implant Prothèse (PIP) breast implants from the same woman. These conditions guarantee that the physical/biological variables are the same for each pair of ruptured and intact implants. A total of 1008 samples from 22 PIP explants (11 intact and 11 ruptured) and three control PIP implants were analysed. The mechanical properties (tensile strength) of the ruptured and intact implants were compared according to brand, lot, implantation time and demographic conditions. In general, statistically significant differences were found between the intact and ruptured PIP implants. Ruptured implants were thinner (0.73 ± 0.10 mm versus 0.91 ± 0.11 mm) and weaker (7.42 ± 2.65 MPa versus 9.59 ± 2.37 MPa) than intact implants. Intact and ruptured implants have shown distinct mechanical behaviours and variations in thickness. Our understanding is that these differences may be associated with the typical manufacturing process of breast implant shells. These results stress the importance of thorough control of the shell thickness. Given its relevance, shell thickness should be used as a quality control measure for homologation purposes. Thus, the homogeneity of the shell should be considered as a relevant parameter during the manufacturing process. This will translate into an improved quality of life for patients and will potentiate safer and longer lasting products.",

Recent theories put into question whether PPN cholinergic neurons form part of a locomotor region that directly regulates the motor output, and rather suggest a modulatory role in adaptive behavior involving both motor and cognitive functions. In support of this, experimental studies in animals suggest that cholinergic neurons reinforce actions by signaling reward prediction and shape adaptations in behavior during changes of environmental contingencies. This is further supported by clinical studies proposing that decreased cholinergic transmission originated in the PPN is associated with impaired sensorimotor integration and perseverant behavior, giving rise to some of the symptoms observed in Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. Altogether, the evidence suggests that cholinergic neurons of the PPN, mainly through their interactions with the basal ganglia, have a leading role in action control.",

The effects of high-level athletic training on such measures of movement control have not, however, been thoroughly evaluated. This study investigated whether elite athletes (who regularly perform knee-specific neuromuscular training) show greater dynamic knee robustness and/or different movement strategies than non-athletic controls, in relation to overall knee function. Thirty-nine women (19 athletes, 20 controls) performed standardized rebound side hops (SRSH) while a motion capture system synchronized with two force plates registered three-dimensional trunk, hip, and knee joint angles and moments. Dynamic knee robustness was evaluated using finite helical axis (FHA) inclination angles extracted from knee rotation intervals of 10°, analyzed with independent t tests. Angle and moment curves were analyzed with inferential methods for functional data. Athletes had superior knee function (less laxity, greater hop performances, and strength) but presented similar FHA inclination angles to controls. Movement strategies during the landing phase differed; athletes presented larger (a) hip flexion angles (during 9%-29% of the phase), (b) hip adduction moments (59%-99%), (c) hip internal rotation moments (83%-89%), and (d) knee flexion moments (79%-93%). Thus, elite athletes may have a greater ability than non-athletes to keep the knee robust while performing SRSH more efficiently through increased engagement of the hip. However, dynamic knee robustness associated with lower FHA inclination angles still show room for improvement, thus possibly decreasing knee injury risk.",

The patient showed adaptation to prosthetic fittings, acquiring a level of functional independence that enabled the patient to lead a nearly independent life. <b>Methods:</b> The patient's therapeutic intervention was divided into a pre-prosthetic phase, which consisted of functional physical adaptation to the amputation and preparation for the prostheses, and a prosthetic phase, in which different myoelectric and microprocessor limb prostheses were integrated to be used functionally. Its functional use was favored by the training with contact electromyography feedback carried out with the Biometrics E-Link System<sup>®</sup> for the upper extremities that has made it possible to obtain many grip options in a natural way, for the lower extremities the use of the intelligent passive prostheses has overcome the functional capacity achieved in this type of patients referenced in the literature who had used prostheses of previous generations such as mechanical passive prostheses. <b>Results:</b> With rehabilitation, the patient showed improvements in the following scales and questionnaires (initial vs. final values): Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire; Functional Independence Measure; Berg Balance Scale; Locomotor Capabilities Index in Amputees (an assessment of overall motor capacity); and Special Interest Group in Amputee Medicine scale (an assessment of the degree of mobility). <b>Conclusions:</b> The patient's age, psychological status, and family and personal support, in addition to technical and economic resources used for next-generation prostheses adapted to this clinical case, were crucial for his progress. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION The use of next-generation myoelectric and microprocessor prostheses makes it possible to achieve greater end functionality in quadruple amputees. Proximal amputation levels present greater difficulty in achieving good functionality. Early and intensive rehabilitation could favour and contribute towards improving psychological states.

A 3D printed upper limb exoskeleton was designed for an individual who had a stroke. Functional and neuromuscular outcomes were measured using his affected hand with and without a 3D printed passive exoskeleton. The goal of this study was to determine the functional and neuromuscular changes induced by the 3D printed exoskeleton in a participant with stroke. <b>Materials and methods:</b> The functional ability of the exoskeleton was assessed using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment and the Box and Block Test. Strength testing and muscle activation of the participant's forearms were measured during maximal voluntary contractions. Furthermore, EMG was measured during the Box and Block Test and satisfaction and usability of the 3D printed exoskeleton were assessed using standardized questionnaires. <b>Results:</b> The exoskeleton improved both the participant's Fugl-Meyer Assessment scores and Box and Block test scores compared to not wearing the device. The subject had increased EMG activation in his extensor when wearing the exoskeleton. <b>Conclusion:</b> The inexpensive 3D printed exoskeleton was effective in assisting the participant with stroke during the functional assessments and has the potential to be used to help regain function of the hand in the home setting of an individual with stroke. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION A 3D printed passive hand exoskeleton may assist to accomplish rehabilitation outcomes by increasing function of the affected hand of patients with stroke. The use of this hand exoskeleton may be used to improve gross hand dexterity and assist with functional grasps during rehabilitation sessions with a lower patient's level of perceived exertion.

Since then, a dynamic shift has taken place and metal-backed tibial (MBT) implants have become the gold standard in TKA. This has mostly been due to the theoretical advantages of intraoperative flexibility and improved biomechanics in addition to the heavy influence of device manufacturers. MBT implant comes not only with a higher cost but also with potential for complications such as osteolysis, backside wear, and thinning of the polyethylene insert, which were not previously seen with APT implant. The majority of studies comparing APT and MBT implants have shown no difference in clinical outcomes and survivorship. Newer studies from the past decade have begun highlighting the economic advantages of APT implant, especially in patients undergoing primary, uncomplicated TKA. Use of APT implants in younger patients and those with a body mass index > 35 has not been extensively studied, but the existing literature suggests the use of APT implant in these cohorts to be equally as acceptable. With modern implant design and instrumentation, rising utilization of TKA along with current and future economic strain on health care, the increased use of APT implant could result in massive savings without sacrificing positive patient outcomes.",

Information and consensus is lacking on the optimal length of the residual length of the femur following the amputation. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that femur length should be kept as long as possible considering construction of the knee unit beneath the socket. Evaluation of the hypothesis: Providing a comprehensive overview of considerations involved in choosing the optimal femur length in a trans-femoral amputation. This explorative study includes a scoping review, interviews with surgeons and certified prosthetists (expert opinions), and a biomechanical analysis. The scoping review resulted in 396 articles reduced to 6 articles after reviewing. All articles, the outcomes of the interviews with the experts and the biomechanical analysis suggest that it is important to maximize the length of the residual femur. CONCLUSION: A longer residual limb length is more beneficial for gait parameters, prevention of contractures, and providing lever arm. Furthermore, the femur should be transected sufficiently proximal to the medial knee joint in order to fit a prosthetic knee at the same height as the contralateral knee. However, it remains unclear what the minimum length of the residual limb should be. This will require further research.",

However, few behavioral endpoints have been measured in fish species such that retention is often assessed using a single parameter (time spent in object area). Here, we aimed to explore the object discrimination test in zebrafish by assessing their behavioral performance after 1 or 24 h retention interval periods. To characterize putative interaction-like behaviors, fish were tested in the absence or presence of scopolamine (1 h before test session). Zebrafish were habituated for 3 consecutive days in the experimental tank, and training session was performed for 10 min using two identical nonpreferred objects (black cube or sphere). After the retention intervals, a familiar object was replaced by a novel object (test session, 10 min). Fish were also exposed to the novel tank diving test to assess locomotion and anxiety-like behaviors. At 1 h retention interval, animals performed more circular-like investigation near the familiar object, whereas 24 h after training session, a prominent rapid investigation was observed when animals explore the nonfamiliar object. Because scopolamine abolished these phenotypes, as well as the increased time spent in the novel object area during the test without changing locomotion and anxiety-related parameters, the behavioral responses described here may predictively reflect interaction-like behaviors involved in object discrimination memory in zebrafish models.",

We present a sampling-based model-predictive controller that comes in the form of a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The tree search utilizes information from multiple sources including two machine learning models. This allows rapid development of complex skills such as 3D humanoid locomotion with less than a million simulation steps, in less than a minute of computing on a modest personal computer. We demonstrate locomotion of 3D characters with varying topologies under disturbances such as heavy projectile hits and abruptly changing target direction. In this paper we also present a new way to combine information from the various sources such that minimal amount of information is lost. We furthermore extend the neural network, involved in the algorithm, to represent stochastic policies. Our approach yields a robust control algorithm that is easy to use. While learning, the algorithm runs in near real-time, and after learning the sampling budget can be reduced for real-time operation.",

Evidence supporting these costs are sparse because animals that move on land or swim have traits reducing those costs, called compensatory traits. Animals that walk underwater, however, are under different environmental pressures than land animals. Buoyancy, for instance, reduces the effective weight of any object, which could decrease the locomotion costs of carrying exagerrated traits. Hence, underwater species might maintain performance without compensation. To test this, we compared males of the freshwater anomuran Aegla longirostri that bear an exaggerated claw to females (the natural control). We first tested whether the exaggerated claw decreased male locomotor performance. Next, we tested if sexual dimorphism in performance is associated with differences in leg asymmetry, length, and muscle size. Lastly, we tested if large males have proportionally heavier legs than smaller males. Unexpectedly, females are faster than males while also having relatively longer legs than males. Therefore, females might walk faster because of the longer legs, which might be unrelated to the male exaggerated claw. Furthermore, larger males did not have proportionally heavier legs than smaller males, further suggesting no compensation. Hence, even though aeglid's claw weigh ~25% of their total body weight, we did not find evidence for burden or compensation on males. The environment might thus decrease the costs of exaggerated traits.",

The benefit on gait freezing is variable and typically incomplete, which may reflect that the clinical application is yet to be optimised or reflect a fundamental limitation of the therapeutic mechanism. Thus, a better understanding of the therapeutic mechanism of PPN DBS may guide the further development of this therapy. The available evidence supports that the PPN is underactive in PD due to a combination of both degeneration and excessive inhibition. Low frequency PPN DBS could enhance PPN network activity, perhaps via disinhibition. A clinical implication is that in some PD patients, the PPN may be too degenerate for PPN DBS to work. Reaction time studies report that PPN DBS mediates a very specific benefit on pre-programmed movement. This seems relevant to the pathophysiology of gait freezing, which can be argued to reflect impaired release of pre-programmed adjustments to locomotion. Thus, the benefit of PPN DBS on gait freezing could be akin to that mediated by external cues. Alpha band activity is a prominent finding in local field potential recordings from PPN electrodes in PD patients. Alpha band activity is implicated in the suppression of task irrelevant processes and thus the effective allocation of attention (processing resources). Attentional deficits are prominent in patients with PD and gait freezing and PPN alpha activity has been observed to drop out prior to gait freezing episodes and to increase with levodopa. This raises the hypothesis that PPN DBS could support or emulate PPN alpha activity and consequently enhance the allocation of attention. Although PPN DBS has not been convincingly shown to increase general alertness or attention, it remains possible that PPN DBS may enhance the allocation of processing resources within the motor system, or ""motor attention"". For example, this could facilitate the 'switching' of motor state between continuation of pattern generated locomotion towards the intervention of pre-programmed adjustments. However, if the downstream consequence of PPN DBS on movement is limited to a circumscribed unblocking of pre-programmed movement, then this may have a similarly circumscribed degree of benefit for gait. If this is the case, then it may be possible to identify patients who may benefit most from PPN DBS. For example, those in whom pre-programmed deficits are the major contributors to gait freezing.",

To implement this in an aquatic robot, one may actively control the surface area of its legs during the swimming. However, a small sized robot with a limited number of actuators should adjust the surface area of legs in passive manner. For this reason, we proposed a novel articulated leg with flexible appendages inspired by a water beetle. This leg structures were designed to implement an efficient recovery stroke with less resistive force during the recovery stroke. While its surface area was increased again if suitable relaxation time was applied to perform improved power stroke. To identify an optimal leg design, 36 different types were fabricated by changing the passive joint thickness, appendage materials, length, and morphology. Several correlations and dominant parameters were identified, and it was shown that the swimming leg with fixed joint and appendage stiffness cannot always generate the largest torque in all the swimming frequency. Also, a two-dimensional dynamic model was proposed based on an underactuated manipulator, and the model validation was proceeded by comparing with two selected leg designs. In addition, a 5.5 cm long robot with one pair of legs was built to further investigate their locomotory performance. By varying the beating frequency and relaxation time, thorough analysis was addressed in terms of the position, velocity, non-dimensional traveled distance, Strouhal number, and quasi-propulsive efficiency. Here, some important relationships between dimensionless numbers were established. Furthermore, it was found that introducing a relaxation phase between the power stroke and recovery stroke can increase the traveled distance per stroke with slight expense of propulsive efficiency.",

To reduce injury risk, sport surfaces should have low rotational traction with artificial surfaces having a potential advantage as components can be manipulated to change surface properties and traction. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence that different components of artificial turf have on rotational traction and athlete lower extremity joint loading. Twelve surfaces underwent mechanical testing to determine the influence of fibre density, fibre length, infill composition and compaction on rotational traction. Following mechanical testing, Control, Low and High Traction surfaces were selected for biomechanical analysis, where sixteen athletes performed maximum effort v-cuts while kinematic/kinetic data were recorded on each surface. Mechanically, fibre density, type of infill and compaction of the surface each independently influenced traction. The traction differences were substantial enough to alter the athlete kinematics and kinetics. Low traction surfaces reduced ankle and knee loading, while high traction surfaces increased ankle and knee loading . Reducing the rotational traction of sport surfaces is possible through alterations of individual components, which may reduce the joint loading at the knee and ankle joint.",

Specific methods such as CORA were developed to objectively evaluate the correlation between a physical test and a numerical simulation results in terms of parameter vs time. However, no metric has so far been developed for Force Vs Deflection (FvD) signals often used in crashworthiness and biomechanics. A unique method called the Minimum Area Discrepancy Method, or MADM, is proposed to address this deficiency. This new method initially calculates a parameter '<i>R</i>' which represents the area between numerical model and the average physical test response and then divides it by the average area generated by the upper and lower test corridors, based on the same standard deviation. The parameter '<i>R</i>' is then normalized between 0 (no correlation) and 1 (perfect correlation) to become the MADM correlation rating. The MADM method was then validated by comparing a one dimensional Finite Element (FE) model of a chest model, under 2 impact velocities, against reference Post Mortem Human Subject (PMHS) data. The MADM method was further used to improve the correlation of this thorax model, by varying model parameters and generating 81 model variations. Based on the MADM ratings, a set parameter values leading to the best fit was identified. The best fit exhibits a response significantly better than the original chest model. MADM is novel, unique, easy to use and fulfills an important gap in objectively evaluating FVD correlation responses.

This paper describes the development of a bicycle helmet evaluation scheme based in real-world cyclist accidents and brain injury mechanisms. Thirty helmet models were subjected to oblique impacts at six helmet locations and two impact velocities. The summation of tests for the analysis of risk (STAR) equation, which condenses helmet performance from a range of tests into a single value, was used to summarize measured linear and rotational head kinematics in the context of concussion risk. STAR values varied between helmets (10.9-25.3), with lower values representing superior protection. Road helmets produced lower STAR values than urban helmets. Helmets with slip planes produced lower STAR values than helmets without.

Eleven subjects performed two 45-min treadmill walking exercises in an uphill (+ 15%) or a downhill (- 15%) condition matched for speed. Maximal voluntary isometric torque (MVIC), voluntary activation level (VAL), doublet (Dt) twitch torque, and M-wave area of the knee extensors were assessed before and after exercise. At the same time-points, motor-evoked potential (MEP), cortical silent period (CSP), and short-interval cortical inhibition (SICI) were recorded in the vastus lateralis (VL) and rectus femoris (RF) muscles. After exercise, uphill and downhill conditions induced a similar loss in MVIC torque (- 9%; p < 0.001), reduction in VAL (- 7%; p < 0.001), and in M-wave area in the VL muscle (- 8%; p < 0.001).

The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), as part of the reticular activating system (RAS), is a major source of the ""bottom-up"" flow of gamma activity to higher regions. However, interruption of gamma band activity is associated with a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders. This review will focus on the role of the PPN in activating higher regions to induce arousal and descending pathways to modulate posture and locomotion. As such, PPN deep brain stimulation (DBS) can not only help regulate arousal and stepping, but continuous application may help maintain necessary levels of gamma band activity for a host of other brain processes. We will explore the potential future applications of PPN DBS for a number of disorders that are characterized by disturbances in gamma band maintenance.",

Sequencing effects of object control and locomotor skill during integrated neuromuscular training in 6- to 7-year-old children. J Strength Cond Res 33(8): 2262-2274, 2019-This study examined whether scheduling of object control (e.g., throwing, catching) and locomotor skills (e.g., running, jumping), within an integrated neuromuscular training program, result in different responses in motor competence, muscular fitness, and perceived motor competence in 6- to 7-year-old children. Seventy-seven boys and 63 girls (N = 140) from 3 primary schools were randomized into 3, 10-week interventions: Loco First (n = 50) where locomotor skills were performed first followed by object control skills, Object First (n = 48) where object control skills were performed first followed by locomotor skills, and a control group (CON) (n = 42) who undertook school physical education. Results indicated greater total motor competence in Loco First and Object First vs. CON (p = 0.001) with the increases in motor competence being greater for Object First vs. Loco First (p = 0.001). Sprint speed (10 m) was lower for object first vs. CON (p = 0.024). Standing long jump distance was greater in Loco First vs. CON (p = 0.0001) and Object First (p = 0.0001). Seated medicine ball throw distance was greater for Loco First and Object First vs. CON (both p = 0.001). Perceived motor competence was also higher for Object First vs. Loco First (p = 0.005) and CON (p = 0.001). This study suggests that scheduling object control skills before locomotor skills within school-based strength and conditioning has a greater effect on motor competence, muscular fitness, and perceived motor competence in 6- to 7-year-old children.",

Biomechanical differences between left- and right-handed college pitchers have been previously reported, but these differences have yet to be examined at the professional level. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare pitching biomechanics between left- and right-handed professional pitchers. It was hypothesised that there would be significant kinematic and kinetic differences between these two groups. Pitching biomechanics were collected on 96 left-handed pitchers and a group of 96 right-handed pitchers matched for age, height, mass and ball velocity. Student <i>t</i>-tests were used to identify kinematic and kinetic differences (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Of the 31 variables tested, only four were found to be significantly different between the groups. Landing position of the stride foot, trunk separation at foot contact, maximum shoulder external rotation and trunk forward tilt at ball release were all significantly greater in right-handed pitchers. The magnitude of the statistical differences found were small and not consistent with differences in the two previous, smaller studies. Thus, the differences found may be of minimal practical significance and mechanics can be taught the same to all pitchers, regardless of throwing hand.",

ROR was 1.76 times higher at 9.5° and 2.47 times higher at 15° compared to a 3.5° slope. Minimum thigh to trunk angle decreased sharply from 80° (3.5° slope) to 50° (9.5° slope) and then to 30° (15° slope) as ramp slope increased. <b>Conclusions:</b> Ascending bus ramps require greater power and pushrim force on steeper ramp slopes, presenting a potential barrier to transportation accessibility. Given this finding, it is imperative that bus operators minimize ramp slope to assure MWC users are able to access LATVs. Implications for Rehabilitation Although transit bus ramps are intended to provide wheelchair access to public transportation, limitations in MWC user physical strength and function may prevent safe access. Transit bus ramp slopes encountered during ingress can present a challenge to MWC users given power output and pushrim force requirements to ascend the ramp. MWC users and therapists should be aware of ramp slopes that may be encountered when boarding transit buses; wheelchair training should incorporate skills needed to ascend transit bus ramps.",

Eleven male runners performed overground running trials on an indoor running track, and three-dimensional analyses techniques were used to measure running kinematics and kinetics. Performance was measured as season and personal best time over 1500 m. The average velocity during the running trials was 7.2 ± 0.3 m/s. The average season and personal best 1500 m race times were 3:49.7 ± 0:05.8 and 3:46.0 ± 0:08.3 minutes, respectively. Regression analysis revealed that a smaller range of sagittal-plane hip motion during swing, less thorax flexion at toe-off and a smaller ankle plantarflexion angle at contact accounted for 95.7% (<i>p</i> < 0.001) of the variation in season best running performance. Less sagittal-plane hip motion during swing and a smaller ankle plantarflexion angle at contact also explained 79% of the variance in personal best time. Slower middle-distance runners make initial ground contact with a more plantarflexed ankle and greater forward lean of the trunk. We recommend that coaches and runners pay attention to ankle, shank and thorax angles during technical development and training to identify opportunities to optimise middle-distance running mechanics and performance.",

These anxiolytic-like effects were followed by decreased delta FosB-immunoreactivity (delta FosB-ir) in the cingulate cortex, dorsolateral and intermediate lateral septum, hippocampus (cornus of Ammon), anterior and dorsomedial hypothalamus, medial and basolateral amygdala and ventral region of the dorsal raphe nucleus. The purpose of the present study was to further investigate behavioral and neurophysiological alterations induced by EE exposure. For that, in a first experiment we verified if increasing the time of exposure to the same EE protocol used in our previous study (from one to two weeks) altered male Wistar rats' ETM escape responses. All animals were tested in an open field, immediately after the ETM, for locomotor activity assessment. Since anxiety and panic-related reactions have been associated to the functioning of specific subnuclei of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), we also evaluated delta FosB-ir in serotonergic cells of DR regions. At last, we analyzed plasma corticosterone levels in animals submitted to EE and to standard housing. Results showed that a two-week exposure to EE decreases both ETM avoidance and escape reactions, inducing anxiolytic and panicolytic-like effects, respectively. There was also a significant decrease in the number of double staining neurons in the midrostral region of the dorsal subnucleus of the dorsal raphe. No changes in corticosterone levels, however, were observed. These results contribute to a better understanding of the effects of EE on anxiety and panic-related responses.",

As part of this research project, we studied the effects of hydrocarbon solvents chemically related to toluene on anxiety-like behavior, passive-avoidance learning, nociception, motor coordination and social interaction. We tested independent groups of adolescent male Wistar rats in the burying behavior task, step through avoidance learning task, hot plate test, shock threshold test, social interaction or rotarod tests after a 30 min exposure to either cyclohexane, benzene, toluene or m-xylene (2000 to 8000 ppm). Control animals breathed only air. Benzene, toluene and m-xylene produced anxiolytic-like actions, impaired learning, caused antinociception and decreased social interaction in a concentration-dependent manner. Locomotor coordination was impaired only with 8000 ppm m-xylene and 8000 ppm toluene. Cyclohexane had no effect on any of the behavioral tasks. Our data suggest that the aromatic ring is critical for solvents to produce a wide variety of behavioral effects.",

Only during controlled mechanical ventilation, as occurs during thoracic surgery and in the intensive care unit, is mechanical loading of the diaphragm arrested. Animal studies indicate that the diaphragm is highly sensitive to unloading, causing rapid muscle fiber atrophy and contractile weakness; unloading-induced diaphragm atrophy and contractile weakness have been suggested to contribute to the difficulties in weaning patients from ventilator support. The molecular triggers that initiate the rapid unloading atrophy of the diaphragm are not well understood, although proteolytic pathways and oxidative signaling have been shown to be involved. Mechanical stress is known to play an important role in the maintenance of muscle mass. Within the muscle's sarcomere, titin is considered to play an important role in the stress-response machinery. Titin is a giant protein that acts as a mechanosensor regulating muscle protein expression in a sarcomere strain-dependent fashion. Thus titin is an attractive candidate for sensing the sudden mechanical arrest of the diaphragm when patients are mechanically ventilated, leading to changes in muscle protein expression. Here, we provide a novel perspective on how titin and its biomechanical sensing and signaling might be involved in the development of mechanical unloading-induced diaphragm weakness.",

The tissue mechanics is modeled by means of a macroscale constitutive model based on a multiscale structural approach. This rationale allows to introduce model parameters directly associated with tissue structural and biochemical features, opening to physically motivated parametric studies. Variance and density-based global sensitivity analyses are employed, together with the quantification of output uncertainty due to stochastic variations of parameters. Novel insights on tissue structure-mechanics relationship are provided, quantifying the dependence between mechanical output quantities on specific collagen-related structural features. Moreover, the uncertainty quantification shows that model predictions provided by the multiscale structural approach are reliable with respect to inevitable uncertainties in tissue structure. Addressing rat tail tendons, the use of average values in tissue properties returns a constitutive response that fits well-available experimental data, and it is robust with respect to parameter stochasticity.",

This study sought to investigate the effect of hesperetin (HPT) on scopolamine-induced memory impairments in mice. Mice were orally pretreated with HPT (1, 5 or 50 mg/kg) or vehicle (normal saline; 10 ml/kg) for 3 consecutive days. One hour post-treatment on day 3, scopolamine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 5 min before locomotor activity (open field test) and memory function (novel object recognition test (NORT) for 2 consecutive days and Morris water maze task (MWM) for 5 consecutive days). Levels of oxidative stress markers / brain derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) and acetylcholinesterase activity were determined in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex after completion of MWM task. Scopolamine caused no significant change in mice exploration of the familiar or novel object in the test session whereas the HPT-treated mice spent more time exploring the novel object more than familiar object in NORT. Scopolamine also increased the escape latency in acquisition phase and decreases time spent in target quadrant in probe phase which were ameliorated by the pretreatment with HPT. Scopolamine-induced alteration of oxidant-antioxidant balance, acetylcholinesterase activity and neurogenesis in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were attenuated by HPT treatment.

Maximising shot put distance and velocity at the point of release through increasing momentum is of interest to coaches. This narrative review aimed to examine and summarise the critical kinematic variables within each of the six phases of rotational shot put associated with performance and release velocity. Databases were searched using 'shot put', 'biomechanics' and 'track and field throwing', from which 20 articles based on the inclusion criteria were reviewed. The results indicate that the magnitude of transverse thrower-shot angular momentum and thrower-shots path of translation are crucial to performance. In achieving high angular momentum, sweep leg and arm actions need to be well-timed, and their timings and movement likely determine key biomechanical events such as hip to shoulder separations. Generating high release velocities stems from the development and transference of momentum through each phase. Kinematics and kinetics within each phase are co-dependent within and across each phase; therefore, coaches should consider the biomechanics of an athlete through preceding phases when seeking biomechanical change within a given phase. Further research and consideration of kinetics and energy transfer would add value to kinematic observations.",

While such organisms fully exploit the potential provided by their soft structures, engineering solutions commonly constrain soft deformation in favor of controllability. In this study, we study how soft deformations can enhance the climbing capabilities of a robot. We introduce a robot called Longitudinally Extensible Continuum-robot inspired by Hirudinea (LEeCH), which has few shape constraints. Inspired by real leeches, LEeCH has a flexible extensible body and two suction cups at the ends. It is capable of performing 3D climbing locomotion using two suction cups driven by vacuum pumps and tri-tube soft actuators which have only three DC motors. The large deformations occurring in LEeCH extend its workspace compared to robots based on constant curvature models, and we show successful locomotion transition from one surface to another at angles between 0° and 180° in experiment. We develop a model based on multibody dynamics to predict the nonlinear deformations of the robot, which we verify in the experiment. The model reveals a nondimensional morphological parameter, which relates the robot's shape to its mass, stiffness, and size. The workspace of LEeCH as a function of this parameter is studied in simulation and is shown to move beyond that of robots based on constant curvature models.",

Finite element structure synthesis (FESS) has previously successfully been used as a deductive technique using Wolff's Law by applying expected loads to an unspecific homogeneous solid and eliminating stress free parts to verify muscle forces. The extended approach presented in this article includes further mechanobiological rules to model the development from a cartilage model to a finger bone. In contrast to former computational models, simulation of processes leading to both external growth and internal differentiation are included. Combined axial and torsional loads synthesize a complete human secondary proximal phalanx model comparable to form and internal structure to that observed in vivo. While the computational model is very sensitive to initial alterations of loads, changes after growth have a minor effect as observed in animal models. Predictions of cartilage growth and ossification during FESS showed significant similarities to ontogeny indicating the importance of mechanical factors for the morphogenesis of bone during growth.

Twenty-eight C57BL/6 mice were used in this study. All mice underwent bilateral surgery with insertion of a small metal clip in the subacromial space or a sham procedure. The supraspinatus tendons underwent histological analyses, biomechanical testing, and RNA extraction for multiplex gene expression analysis (NanoString, Seattle, WA). Histology demonstrated increased cellularity and disorganized collagen fibers of the supraspinatus tendon in the clip impingement group. Mean load to failure (5.20 N vs. 1.50 N, p<0.001) and mean stiffness (4.95 N/mm vs. 1.47 N/mm, p<0.001) were lower in the impingement group than the sham group.

A biomechanical rat model study.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of vascularized and non-vascularized fascial flaps on tendon healing, specifically the maximum strain, maximum stress, elasticity and resistance of the repaired tendon. Rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: Group 1 - primary repair; Group 2 - vascularized pedicled fascial graft; Group 3 - non-vascularized free fascial graft. The rats were euthanized after 2 weeks and 40 mm-long samples were taken from the Achilles tendon and gastrocnemius muscle. To evaluate the mechanical properties of the tendons, maximum load, maximum deformation, energy stored until yield point and stiffness on the load-deformation curve were measured. Based on this mechanical testing, the best group in terms of tissue strength and quality was the primary repair group. When the samples were examined individually, the two samples with the highest breaking force after the control group were in the pedicled graft group. The worst results overall were in the free graft group. We believe that if the blood flow is preserved for the fascial flap in the pedicled graft group, the tendon's breaking force would be higher.",

Sacral orientation and external morphology in modern humans are distinct from those in other primates and compatible with the demands of habitual bipedal locomotion. Among nonhuman primates, however, how sacral anatomy relates to positional behaviors is less clear. As an alternative to evaluation of the sacrum's external morphology, this study assesses if the sacrum's internal morphology (i.e., trabecular bone) differs among extant primates. The primary hypothesis tested is that trabecular bone parameters with established functional relevance will differ in the first sacral vertebra (S1) among extant primates that vary in positional behaviors. Results for analyses of individual variables demonstrate that bone volume fraction, degree of anisotropy, trabecular number, and size-corrected trabecular thickness differ among primates grouped by positional behaviors to some extent, but not always in ways consistent with functional expectations. When examined as a suite, these trabecular parameters distinguish obligate bipeds from other positional behavior groups; and, the latter three trabecular bone variables further distinguish knuckle-walking terrestrial quadrupeds from manual suspensor-brachiators, vertical clingers and leapers, and arboreal quadrupeds, as well as between arboreal and terrestrial quadrupeds. As in other regions of the skeleton in modern humans, trabecular bone in S1 exhibits distinctively low bone volume fraction. Results from this study of extant primate S1 trabecular bone structural variation provide a functional context for interpretations concerning the positional behaviors of extinct primates based on internal sacral morphology.

That previous version already replaced strenuous manual protocols to characterize muscle biomechanics properties and offered automated data analysis. Here, the system was further improved for precise control over experimental temperature and muscle single fiber sarcomere length. Moreover, it also now features the calculation of fiber cross-sectional area via on-the-fly optical diameter measurements using custom-engineered microscope optics. With this optical systems integration, the MyoRobot 2.0 allows to tailor a wealth of recordings for relevant physiological parameters to be sequentially executed in living single myofibers. Research questions include assessing temperature-dependent performance of active or passive biomechanics, or automated control over length-tension or length-velocity relations. The automatically obtained passive stress-strain relationships and elasticity modules are important parameters in (bio)material science. From the plethora of possible applications, we validated the improved MyoRobot 2.0 by assessing temperature-dependent myofibrillar Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity, passive axial compliance and Young's modulus. We report a Ca<sup>2+</sup> desensitization and a narrowed dynamic range at higher temperatures in murine M. extensor digitorum longus single fibers. In addition, an increased axial mechanical compliance in single muscle fibers with Young's moduli between 40 - 60 kPa was found, compatible with reported physiological ranges.

Stent design and drug-elution strategies have evolved over the years leading to the last generation DES which shows optimal safety and efficacy outcome. Peripheral arteries have different mechanical and biological features and the lessons learned from the coronary field have been difficult to introduce into the development of peripheral vascular technologies. First, due to its complex biomechanical behavior the use of metallic stents is limited in some vascular segments (i.e., distal superficial fermoral artery [SFA]). Also, peripheral vascular atherosclerosis is different containing higher levels of plaque burden and calcium. Finally, peripheral arterial disease tends to be more aggressive including longer lesions and higher incidence of total chronic occlusion. In general terms, restenosis in the peripheral vascular territory is more aggressive and occurs at a later time (~12 months) requiring a different pharmacokinetic profile compared to coronary technologies. Several strategies have been evaluated in the peripheral arteries raging from the bare metal stent to the drug coated balloon and drug eluting stent with outcome varying depending on the different field of application (i.e. SFA and below-the-knee). Results coming from the clinical trial are encouraging but further studies and direct comparison among the different technologies are demanded to determine the best therapy for peripheral vascular disease.",

Growing evidence suggests that genes associated with specific illnesses tend to interact together and encode a tight protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, providing valuable information for understanding their pathogenesis. To gain insights into the genetic and physiological foundation of BPD, we conduct the physical PPI analysis of 184 BPD risk genes distilled from genome-wide association studies and exome sequencing studies. We have identified several hub genes (CAMK2A, HSP90AA1 and PLCG1) among those risk genes, and observed significant enrichment of the BPD risk genes in certain pathways such as calcium signaling, oxytocin signaling and circadian entrainment. Furthermore, while none of the 184 genetic risk genes are ""well established"" BPD drug targets, our PPI analysis showed that αCaMKII (encoded by CAMK2A) had direct physical PPIs with targets (HRH1, SCN5A and CACNA1E) of clinically used anti-manic BPD drugs, such as carbamazepine. We thus speculated that αCaMKII might be involved in the cellular pharmacological actions of those drugs. Using cultured rat primary cortical neurons, we found that carbamazepine treatment induced phosphorylation of αCaMKII in dose-dependent manners. Intriguingly, previous study showed that CAMK2A heterozygous knockout (CAMK2A<sup>+/-</sup>) mice exhibited infradian oscillation of locomotor activities that can be rescued by carbamazepine. Our data, in combination with previous studies, provide convergent evidence for the involvement of CAMK2A in the risk of BPD.",

Intriguingly, genetic or pharmacological manipulation of CRF receptors affects locomotor activity as well as motor coordination and balance in rodents, suggesting an active involvement of the central CRFergic system in motor control. Yet little is known about the exact role of CRF in central motor structures and the underlying mechanisms. Therefore, in the present study, we focused on the effect of CRF on the lateral vestibular nucleus (LVN) in the brainstem vestibular nuclear complex, an important center directly contributing to adjustment of muscle tone for both postural maintenance and the alternative change from the extensor to the flexor phase during locomotion. The results show that CRF depolarizes and increases the firing rate of neurons in the LVN. Tetrodotoxin does not block the CRF-induced depolarization and inward current on LVN neurons, suggesting a direct postsynaptic action of the neuropeptide. The CRF-induced depolarization on LVN neurons was partly blocked by antalarmin or antisauvagine-30, selective antagonists for CRF receptors 1 (CRFR1) and 2 (CRFR2), respectively. Furthermore, combined application of antalarmin and antisauvagine-30 totally abolished the CRF-induced depolarization. Immunofluorescence results show that CRFR1 and CRFR2 are co-localized in the rat LVN. These results demonstrate that CRF excites the LVN neurons by co-activation of both CRFR1 and CRFR2, suggesting that via the direct modulation on the LVN, the central CRFergic system may actively participate in the central vestibular-mediated postural and motor control.",

We investigated the effects of fluorene-9-bisphenol (BHPF), one substitute of bisphenol A, on courtship behavior and exploratory behavior of adult zebrafish. Customized apparatus was used to evaluate courtship behavior. The result showed that the male spent less time with BHPF and anti-oestrogenic fulvestrant (FULV) treated female in region of approaching (ROA). Courtship index between BHPF-exposed female and male decreased. The body orientation of BHPF- and FULV-exposed female to male decreased. Furthermore, BHPF exposure downregulated the expression of genes related to estrogen receptor, steroidogenesis and upregulated oxidative stress related genes. It indicated that BHPF exposure interfered the preference of male and female in courtship, and induced detrimental effects on reproduction. BHPF treatment decreased locomotor activity and time spent in top, increased freezing bouts, and induced anxiety/depression-like behavior. The tyrosine hydroxylase in brain decreased under BHPF exposure. Here we showed the potential adverse effects of BHPF on reproduction and exploratory behaviors.",

Twelve cadaveric patella specimens were used (six matched pairs). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements were performed to ensure equal bone quality among groups. All right knees were assigned to the suture anchor repair group (<i>n</i> = 6), whereas all left knees were assigned to the transosseous bone tunnel group (<i>n</i> = 6). Suture type and repair configuration were equivalent. After the respective procedures were performed, each patella was mounted into a gripping jig. Tensile load was applied at a rate of 1 Hz between magnitudes of 50 and 150 N, 50 and 200 N, 50 and 250 N, and tensile load at a rate of 0.1 mm/s until failure. Failure was defined as a sharp deviation in the linear load versus displacement curve, and failure mode was recorded. DXA measurements demonstrated equivalence of bone quality between the two groups (<i>p</i> > 0.05). During cyclic load testing, there was only a statistically significant difference between the groups with regard to cyclic loading at the 50 to 200 N loading cycle (<i>p</i> = 0.010). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups with regard to ultimate load to failure (<i>p</i> = 0.43). Failure mode within the suture anchor cohort occurred through anchor pullout except for one, which failed through the tendon. All specimens within the transosseous cohort failed through the midsubstance of the tendon except for one, which failed through suture breakage. Suture anchor repair demonstrated a similar biomechanical profile regarding cyclic loading and ultimate load to failure when compared with ""gold standard"" transosseous tunnel patellar tendon repair with a trend toward less gapping in the suture anchor group. Using suture anchors for repair of the patella tendon has similar biomechanical properties to transpatellar tunnels but may provide other clinical advantages.",

Members of the Sciuromorpha (""squirrel-like"" rodents) display a diversity of locomotor ecologies and span three orders of magnitude in terms of body size. The availability of robust phylogenies is rendering them a suitable group to further substantiate the relationship of long bone CSP with locomotor ecology and body mass while taking the phylogenetic non-independence among species into account. Here, we studied 69 species of Sciuromorpha belonging to three lifestyle categories, ""arboreal,"" ""fossorial,"" and ""aerial"" (i.e., gliding). We hypothesized locomotor category specific loading regimes that act on femora during predominant or, in terms of gliding, critical locomotor behaviors of each category. High resolution computed tomography scans of the specimens' femora were obtained and cross-sections in 5% increments were analyzed. Cross-sectional area, the craniocaudal second moment of area (SMA<sub>cc</sub> ), and the mediolateral second moment of area were quantified. Further, a scaling analysis was conducted for each bone cross-section to examine how the CSP scale with body mass. Body mass accounted for variances in CSP with mainly positive allometry. The aerial sciuromorphs showed lower values of CSP compared to the arboreal and fossorial species in the distal epiphysis for all quantified parameters and along the bone for SMA<sub>cc</sub> . In contrast to previous studies on other mammalian lineages, no differences in CSP were found between the fossorial and the arboreal lifestyles.",

Here, a previously unnoticed structural mechanism of fibrin clots' mechanical response to external tensile loads is tested using high-resolution confocal microscopy and recently developed three-dimensional computational model. This mechanism, underlying local strain-stiffening of individual fibers as well as global stiffening of the entire network, is based on previously neglected nascent cohesive pairwise interactions between individual fibers (crisscrossing) in fibrin networks formed under tensile load. Existence of fiber-fiber crisscrossings of reoriented fibers was confirmed using 3D imaging of experimentally obtained stretched fibrin clots. The computational model enabled us to study structural details and quantify mechanical effects of the fiber-fiber cohesive crisscrossing during stretching of fibrin gels at various spatial scales. The contribution of the fiber-fiber cohesive contacts to the elasticity of stretched fibrin networks was characterized by changes in individual fiber stiffness, the length, width, and alignment of fibers, as well as connectivity and density of the entire network. The results show that the nascent cohesive crisscrossing of fibers in stretched fibrin networks comprise an underappreciated important structural mechanism underlying the mechanical response of fibrin to (patho)physiological stresses that determine the course and outcomes of thrombotic and hemostatic disorders, such as heart attack and ischemic stroke. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Fibrin is a viscoelastic proteinaceous polymer that determines the deformability and integrity of blood clots and fibrin-based biomaterials in response to biomechanical forces. In this paper, a novel structural mechanism of fibrin clots' mechanical response to external tensile loads is tested using high-resolution confocal microscopy and newly developed computational model. This mechanism, underlying local strain-stiffening of individual fibers as well as global stiffening of the entire network, is based on previously neglected nascent cohesive pairwise interactions between individual fibers (crisscrossing) in fibrin networks formed under tensile load. Cohesive crisscrossing is an important structural mechanism that influences the mechanical response of blood clots and which can determine the outcomes of blood coagulation disorders, such as heart attacks and strokes.",

During the past decade, the establishment of iPSC lines of a series of large animal species has been documented, and the acquisition and preclinical evaluation of iPSC-derived somatic cells has also been reported. Despite this progress, significant obstacles, such as obtaining or preserving the bona fide pluripotency of large animal iPSCs, have been encountered. Simultaneously, studies of large animal iPSCs have been overlooked in comparison with those of mouse and human iPSCs, and this field deserves more attention and support due to its important preclinical relevance. Herein, this review will focus on the large animal models of pigs, dogs, horses and sheep/goats, and summarize current progress, challenges, and potential future directions of research on large animal iPSCs.",

The wall of the conduit consists of two electrospun layers (inner and outer) and one textile layer (middle), perfectly integrated at the structural and functional level. The manufacturing technology conferred high compression strength on the device, thus meeting clinical requirements for physiological and pathological compressive stresses. In vitro cell interaction studies were performed through direct contact assays with SilkBridge™ using the glial RT4-D6P2T cells, a schwannoma cell line, and a mouse motor neuron NSC-34 cell line. The results revealed that the material is capable of sustaining cell proliferation, that the glial RT4-D6P2T cells increased their density and organized themselves in a glial-like morphology, and that NSC-34 motor neurons exhibited a greater neuritic length with respect to the control substrate. In vivo pilot assays were performed on adult female Wistar rats. A 10 mm long gap in the median nerve was repaired with 12 mm SilkBridge™. At two weeks post-operation several cell types colonized the lumen. Cells and blood vessels were also visible between the different layers of the conduit wall. Moreover, the presence of regenerated myelinated fibers with a thin myelin sheath at the proximal level was observed. Taken together, all these results demonstrated that SilkBridge™ has an optimized balance of biomechanical and biological properties, being able to sustain a perfect cellular colonization of the conduit and the progressive growth of the regenerating nerve fibers.",

In contrast to the earlier conventional design concepts, e.g., raster-angle, a workflow was established to produce scaffolds with triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) architecture. A core challenge is the realization of such structures using melt-extrusion based 3D printing. This study presents methods for generation of scaffold design files, finite element analysis of scaffold Young's moduli, AM of scaffolds with polycaprolactone (PCL), and a customized in vitro assay to evaluate cell migration. The reliability of FE analysis when using computer-aided designed models as input may be impeded by anomalies introduced into the scaffolds during 3D printing. Further investigation using micro-computed tomography reconstructions of printed scaffolds as an input for numerical simulation in comparison to experimentally obtained scaffold Young's moduli showed a moderate trend (R2 = 0.62). Interestingly, in a preliminary cell migration assay, adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AdMSC) migrated furthest on PCL scaffolds with Diamond, followed by Gyroid and Schwarz P architectures. A similar trend, but with an accelerated AdMSC migration rate, was observed for PCL scaffolds surface coated with calcium-phosphate-based apatite. We elaborate on the importance of start-to-finish integration of all steps of AM, i.e. design, engineering and manufacturing. Using such a workflow, specific biological and mechanical functionality, e.g., improved regeneration via enhanced cell migration and higher structural integrity, may be realized for scaffolds intended as temporary guiding structures for endogenous tissue regeneration.",

However, the underlying mechanisms for these responses, as well as how these responses change throughout disease progression, are not completely understood. For this study, we examined the effect of the progression of T2DM on the exercise pressor reflex, a critical neurocardiovascular mechanism that functions to increase sympathetic activity and blood pressure during exercise. We also aimed to examine the effect of T2DM on reflexive cardiovascular responses to static contraction, as well as those responses to tendon stretch when an exaggerated exercise pressor reflex was present. We evoked the exercise pressor reflex and mechanoreflex by statically contracting the hindlimb muscles and stretching the Achilles tendon, respectively, for 30 s. We then compared pressor and cardioaccelerator responses in unanesthetized, decerebrated University of California Davis (UCD)-T2DM rats at 21 and 31 wk following the onset of T2DM to responses in healthy nondiabetic rats. We found that the pressor response to static contraction was greater in the 31-wk T2DM [change in mean arterial pressure (∆MAP) = 39 ± 5 mmHg] but not in the 21-wk T2DM (∆MAP = 24 ± 5 mmHg) rats compared with nondiabetic rats (∆MAP = 18 ± 2 mmHg; <i>P</i> < 0.05). Similarly, the pressor and the cardioaccelerator responses to tendon stretch were significantly greater in the 31-wk T2DM rats [∆MAP = 69 ± 6 mmHg; change in heart rate (∆HR) = 28 ± 4 beats/min] compared with nondiabetic rats (∆MAP = 14 ± 2 mmHg; ∆HR = 5 ± 3 beats/min; <i>P</i> < 0.05). These findings suggest that the exercise pressor reflex changes as T2DM progresses and that a sensitized mechanoreflex may play a role in exaggerating these cardiovascular responses.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> This is the first study to provide evidence that as type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) progresses, the exercise pressor reflex becomes exaggerated, an effect that may be due to a sensitized mechanoreflex. Moreover, these findings provide compelling evidence suggesting that impairments in the reflexive control of circulation contribute to exaggerated blood pressure responses to exercise in T2DM.",

Precise numerical analysis of the air pressure curve from the raw data, distinct local disturbances of the curve, which appear almost exactly at the time of the first and the second applanations. Thirty measurements taken on six eyes show clear dependencies between times of both applanations and appearances of local wave disturbances on the air pressure curve as well as between the amplitude of pressure wave disturbances and the respective height of applanation curve. These findings can be interpreted as a result of very fast corneal buckling, that produces the air pressure wave, propagating from the cornea towards the device. The quantitative dependencies measured and described in this study, enable to characterize the individual buckling during respective applanations. Due to these individual characterizations and dependencies it is possible to understand and describe better the ultrafast corneal applanation process. Such phenomena could likely be employed to increase the accuracy of measured parameters by ORA or for identifying new types of biomechanical properties of the cornea.",

It is thus believed that, by mapping the viscoelastic features of an embryo at different stages of growth, it may be possible to shed light on the role of mechanics in embryonic development. To contribute to this field, we present a new instrument that can determine spatiotemporal distributions of mechanical properties of embryos over a wide area and with unprecedented accuracy. The method relies on combining ferrule-top micro-indentation, which provides local measurements of viscoelasticity, with Optical Coherence Tomography, which can reveal changes in tissue morphology and help the user identify the indentation point. To prove the working principle, we have collected viscoelasticity maps of fixed and live HH11-HH12 chicken embryos. Our study shows that the instrument can reveal correlations between tissue morphology and mechanical behavior. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Local mechanical properties of soft biological tissue play a crucial role in several biological processes, including cell differentiation, cell migration, and body formation; therefore, measuring tissue properties at high resolution is of great interest in biology and tissue engineering. To provide an efficient method for the biomechanical characterization of soft biological tissues, we introduce a new tool in which the combination of non-invasive Optical Coherence Tomography imaging and depth-controlled indentation measurements allows one to map the viscoelastic properties of biological tissue and investigate correlations between local mechanical features and tissue morphology with unprecedented resolution.",

In physiotherapy, the use of the microcurrent apparatus is associated with certain drugs (Iontophoresis) to increase the topical penetration and to associate the effects of both therapies. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of iontophoresis along with GNPs in the skeletal muscle of rats exposed to a traumatic muscle injury. We utilized 50 Wistar rats randomly divided in to five experimental groups (n = 10): Control group (CG); Muscle injury group (MI); MI + GNPs (20 nm, 30mg/kg); MI + Microcurrent (300 μA); and MI + Microcurrent + GNPs. The treatment was performed daily for 7 days, with the first session starting at 24h after the muscle injury. The animals were sacrificed and the gastrocnemius muscle was surgically removedand stored for the proper evaluations. The group that received iontophoresis with GNPs showed significant differences in inflammation and oxidative stress parameters and in the histopathological evaluation showed preserved morphology. In addition, we observed an improvement in the locomotor response and pain symptoms of these animals.

The hypothesis, inferred from prevailing literature, was that these structures would have minimal influence (differences less than ±10%). Two models were made using the Visible Human Project's female cadaver to create a rigid, fixed pelvis, musculature held by spring attachments to that pelvis, and a rigid, ellipsoidal fetal head prescribed with an inferior displacement to simulate delivery. Injury site stretch ratios and fetal head and perineal body displacements and angles of progression were compared between the Omitted Model (which excluded the superficial perineal structures as is common practice) and the Included Model (which included them). Included Model stretch ratios were +107%, -9.84% and -14.6% compared to Omitted Model perineal body and right and left pubovisceral muscles, respectively. Included Model peak perineal body inferior displacement was +72.5% greater while similar anterior-posterior displacements took longer to reach. These results refute our hypothesis, suggesting superficial perineal structures impact simulations of vaginal delivery by inhibiting perineal body anterior-posterior displacement, which stretches and inferiorly displaces the perineal body.",

This study examines the use of electrochemically aligned collagen (ELAC) threads woven into biotextile scaffolds as grafts to repair critical infraspinatus tendon defects in New Zealand White rabbits. Three surgical treatment groups were evaluated: rabbits undergoing direct repair as operative controls, rabbits receiving ELAC scaffolds alone, and rabbits treated with mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-seeded ELAC scaffolds. In each animal, the intact, contralateral infraspinatus served as an internal positive control. Tendon-bone constructs were harvested after 3 months in vivo and outcome measures included biomechanical testing, histological staining, and immunohistochemical staining. Biomechanical testing revealed that maximum load-bearing capacity was comparable between all groups, while MSC-seeded scaffold repairs exhibited increased stiffness relative to non-seeded scaffold repairs. Histological staining revealed robust collagen deposition around ELAC fibers and increased cellularity within the continuum of woven scaffolds as compared to native tendon. Immunohistochemical staining revealed presence of collagens I and III in all groups, but procollagen I and the tendon-specific marker tenomodulin were only observed in seeded and non-seeded ELAC scaffold repairs.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of various corneal incisions on pneumotonometer accuracy in enucleated porcine eyes. <b>Materials and Methods</b>: A pneumotonometer was used to measure IOP (IOPp) at manometrically controlled pressure levels of 10, 20, 30 and 40 mmHg in enucleated porcine eyes. IOP measurements at each level were repeated after one of the following corneal incisions: radial keratotomy (8 eyes), lamellar dissection (10 eyes), clear cornea standard phacoemulsification incisions (10 eyes). The pneumotonometer error, defined as the difference between IOPp and manometric pressure (IOPm), was calculated for each pressure level. The error before the corneal incisions was compared to the error after the corneal incisions to assess the accuracy of the pneumotonometer. <b>Results</b>: The pneumotonometer underestimates true IOP at all pressure levels, both before and after the corneal procedures. There was a statistically significant greater underestimation of IOP after radial keratotomy incisions at pressure levels of 20, 30 and 40 mmHg (p= 0.013, 0.004, and 0.002, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in the amount of pneumotonometer underestimation error after lamellar dissection or standard cataract incisions. <b>Conclusion</b>: The pneumotonometer underestimates true IOP in enucleated porcine eyes at all pressure levels between 10-40 mmHg. Radial keratotomy incisions caused a statistically significant greater underestimation error in pneumotonometry measurements at pressures of 20-40 mmHg. Lamellar dissection and clear corneal cataract incisions did not cause an additional error in pneumotonometry measurements in enucleated porcine eyes.",

Living cells have been mechanically investigated by several approaches. Among them, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is widely used thanks to its high versatility and sensitivity. In the case of large cells or 3D multicellular aggregates, standard AFM probes may not be appropriate to investigate the mechanical properties of the whole biological system. Owing to their size, standard AFM probes can compress only a single somatic cell or part of it. To fill this gap, we have designed and fabricated planar AFM macro-probes compatible with commercial AFM instruments. The probes are constituted of a large flat compression plate, connected to the chip by two flexible arms, whose mechanical characteristics are tuned for specific biological applications. As proof of concept, we have used the macro-probes to measure the viscoelasticity of large spherical biological systems, which have a diameter above 100 μm: human oocytes and 3D cell spheroids. Compression experiments are combined with visual inspection, using a side-view configuration imaging, which allows us to monitor the sample morphology during the compression and to correlate it with the viscoelastic parameters. Our measurements provide a quantitative estimate of the relaxation times of such biological systems, which are discussed in relation to data present in literature. The broad applicability of the AFM macro-probes can be relevant to study the biomechanical features in any biological process involving large soft materials. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The understanding of the role of physical factors in defining cell and tissue functions requires to develop new methods or improve the existing ones to accurately measure the biomechanical properties. AFM is a sensitive and versatile tool to measure the mechanical features from single proteins to single cells. When cells or cell aggregates exceed few tens of microns, AFM suffers from limitations. On these biological systems the control of the contact area and the application of a precise uniform compression becomes crucial. A modification of the standard cantilevers fabrication allowed us obtaining AFM macro-probes, having large planar contact area and spring constant suitable for biological investigations. They were demonstrated valuable to characterize the mechanical properties of large hierarchical biological systems.",

However, the processing difficulty and poor osteoinductive ability greatly limit the application of HA. Although many strategies have been reported to improve the machinability and osteointegration ability, the performance including mechanical strength, porosity, cell adhesion, <i>etc.</i> of material still can not meet the requirements. In this work, a soft template method was developed and a porous scaffold with hierarchical pore structure, nano surface morphology, suitable porosity and pore size, and good biomechanical strength was successfully prepared. The hierarchical pore structure is beneficial for cell adhesion, fluid transfer, and cell ingrowth. Moreover, the loaded reduced graphene oxide (rGO) can improve the adhesion and promote the proliferation and spontaneous osteogenic differentiation bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. The scaffold is then crushed, degraded and wrapped by the newly formed bone and the newly formed bone gradually replaces the scaffold. The degradation rate of the scaffold well matches the rate of the new bone formation. The hierarchical porous HA/rGO composite scaffolds can greatly accelerate the bone ingrowth in the scaffold and bone repair in critical bone defects, thus providing a clinical potential candidate for large segment bone tissue engineering.",

This new simulation platform allows for the construction of an array of models that objectively represent the key anatomical and functional variation in women with and without prolapse to test pathomechanism hypotheses of the prolapse formation. POP-SIM1.0 consists of anatomically based FE models and a suite of Python-based tools developed to rapidly construct FE models by customizing the base model with desired structural parameters. Each model consists of anatomical structures from three support subsystems which can be customized based on magnetic resonance image measurements in women with and without prolapse. The customizable structural parameters include presence of levator ani (LA) avulsion, hiatus size, anterior vaginal wall dimension, attachment fascia length and apical location in addition to the tissue material properties and intra-abdominal pressure loading. After customization, the FE model was loaded with increasing intra-abdominal pressure (0-100 cmH<sub>2</sub>O) and solved using ABAQUS explicit solver. We were able to rapidly construct anatomically based FE models with specific structural geometry which reflects the morphology changes often observed in women with prolapse. At maximum loading, simulated structural deformations have similar anatomical characteristics to those observed during clinical exams and stress magnetic resonance images. Simulation results showed the presence of LA muscle avulsion negatively impacts the pelvic floor support. The normal model with intact muscle had the smallest exposed vaginal length of 11 mm, while the bilateral avulsion produced the largest exposed vaginal length at 24 mm. The unilateral avulsion model had an exposed vaginal length of 18 mm and also demonstrated a tipped perineal body similar to that seen in clinical observation. Increasing the hiatus size, vaginal wall length and fascia length also resulted in worse pelvic floor support, increasing the exposed vaginal length from 18 mm in the base model to 33 mm, 54 mm and 23.5 mm, respectively. The developed POP-SIM1.0 can simulate the anatomical structure changes often observed in women with prolapse. Preliminary results showed that the presence of LA avulsion, enlarged hiatus, longer vaginal wall and fascia length can result in larger prolapse at simulated maximum Valsalva.",

Articular cartilage possesses an inhomogeneous structure throughout its thickness, driving the associated variation in the biomechanical strain profile within the tissue under physiological compressive loading. However, little is known experimentally about the nanostructural mechanical role of the collagen fibrils and how this varies with depth. Utilising a high-brilliance synchrotron X-ray source, we have measured the depth-wise nanostructural parameters of the collagen network in terms of the periodic fibrillar banding (D-period) and associated parameters. We show that there is a depth dependent variation in D-period reflecting the pre-strain and concurrent with changes in the level of intrafibrillar order. Further, prolonged static compression leads to fibrillar changes mirroring those caused by removal of extrafibrillar proteoglycans (as may occur in aging or disease). We suggest that fibrillar D-period is a sensitive indicator of localised changes to the mechanical environment at the nanoscale in soft connective tissues. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Collagen plays a significant role in both the structural and mechanical integrity of articular cartilage, allowing the tissue to withstand highly repetitive loading. However, the fibrillar mechanics of the collagen network in cartilage are not clear. Here we find that cartilage has a spatial gradient in the nanostructural collagen fibril pre-strain, with an increase in the fibrillar pre-strain with depth. Further, the fibrillar gradient changes similarly under compression when compared to an enzymatically degraded tissue which mimics age-related changes. Given that the fibrils potentially have a finite capacity to mechanically respond and alter their configuration, these findings are significant in understanding how collagen may alter in structure and gradient in diseased cartilage, and in informing the design of cartilage replacements.",

It is a rare corneal disorder that shares many clinical characteristics with other corneal ectasias, such as keratoconus, keratoglobus or Terrien marginal degeneration. PMD usually starts later in life than keratoconus and progresses slower than keratoconus. Slit-lamp examination is very useful to distinguish PMD from other corneal ectatic disorders with inflammatory nature. Corneal topographic indices and the classical crab-claw topographic pattern cannot be used as the main tool to distinguish between PMD and keratoconus. New Scheimpflug imaging-based devices have shown the importance and usefulness of the pachymetric map for an appropriate diagnosis of PMD. In addition, biomechanical and densitometric properties have been studied as complementary techniques to help in the diagnosis of PMD.",

Here, we use 3D-scanning techniques to assess the usefulness of a carpal bone, the scapholunar, in carnivorans to reflect ecology and habitat, and to reconstruct the ecology of five extinct carnivorans from two fossil sites: Rancho La Brea and Natural Trap Cave. We 3D-scanned scapholunars and measured articular surface areas and angles between articular facets using GeoMagic and Rhino 3D-software. We analyzed the difference in these metrics using multivariate analysis of variance and discriminant function analysis. Results show that the scapholunar reflects ecological signal, with clear groupings of cursorial carnivorans and grappling/climbing carnivorans; however, phylogenetic signal was also present in the results with hyaenids, canids, and large felids in distinct morphospaces. Extinct species Miracinonyx trumani (American cheetah) and Smilodon fatalis (sabertooth cat) showed surprising results with M. trumani grouping with pantherines instead of Acinonyx or Puma, suggesting it runs but still retains the ability to grapple prey. S. fatalis groups with pantherines, but also shows some unique adaptations, suggesting it had a different range of wrist motion than living cats. Overall, the scapholunar is a good indicator of ecology and functional morphology and can be another tool to use in modern and fossil carnivorans to reconstruct extinct ecologies and locomotor behaviors.",

Resistance involves physical and chemical traits that deter and/or harm herbivores whereas tolerance minimizes fitness costs of herbivory, often via compensatory growth. The Poaceae frequently accumulate large amounts of silicon (Si), which can be used for herbivore resistance, including biomechanical and (indirectly) biochemical defences. To date, it is unclear whether Si improves tolerance of herbivory. Here we report how Si enabled a cereal (Triticum aestivum) to tolerate damage inflicted by above- and belowground herbivores. Leaf herbivory increased Si concentrations in the leaves by greater than 50% relative to herbivore-free plants, indicating it was an inducible defensive response. In plants without Si supplementation, leaf herbivory reduced shoot biomass by 52% and root herbivory reduced root biomass by 68%. Si supplementation, however, facilitated compensatory growth such that shoot losses were more than compensated for (+14% greater than herbivore-free plants) and root losses were minimized to -16%. Si supplementation did not improve plant resistance since Si did not enhance biomechanical resistance (i.e. force of fracture) or reduce leaf consumption and herbivore relative growth rates. We propose that Si-based defence operates in wheat via tolerance either in addition or as an alternative to resistance-based defence.",

Alternative treatments of canine osteoarthritis would be desirable and, recently nutraceuticals, have been proposed for this purpose. Twenty cross breed adult dogs affected by osteoarthritis were enrolled and equally divided into two groups (control vs. experimental). The nutritional supplement (Dynamopet srl, Verone, Italy) was administered for 90 days to the dogs of the experimental group in order to evaluate its metabolic and locomotor effects. All the clinical signs (lameness, pain on manipulation and palpation, range of motion and joint swelling) significantly (p < 0.01) improved during the trial as regards the experimental group. This group showed a significantly lower joint score than the control group (mean value 7.40 vs. 3.80). With regard to haematology, the mean corpuscular volume resulted significantly (p < 0.01) higher in the experimental group, i.e. alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol and triglycerides values decreased and were significantly (p < 0.01) lower than the control one, thus suggesting an improvement in bone remodelling and lipid metabolism. A decrease in the reactive oxygen metabolites and an increase in the biological antioxidant potential demonstrated an improvement in oxidative stress during the trial in the experimental group compare to the control group. Interleukins 6 decreased in the experimental group, while interleukins 10 resulted in the opposite trend. Moreover, the administration of up to 3 months of the studied supplement was well tolerated in the dogs and caused no adverse effects.",

Yet relatively little work has been done on the molecular underpinnings of nervous system function in lamprey. This is due in part to a paucity of gene information for some of the most fundamental proteins involved in neural activity: ion channels. We report here 47 putative ion channel sequences in the central nervous system (CNS) of larval lampreys from the predicted coding sequences (CDS) discovered in the P. marinus genome. These include 32 potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) channels, six sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) channels, and nine calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) channels. Through RT-PCR, we examined the distribution of these ion channels in the anterior (ARRN), middle (MRRN), and posterior (PRRN) rhombencephalic reticular nuclei, as well as the spinal cord (SC). This study lays the foundation for incorporating more advanced molecular techniques to investigate the role of ion channels in the neural networks of the lamprey.",

Such analysis enables accurate evaluation of the vertical force distribution (VFD) in canine paw pads. The aim of this study was to assess peak vertical force (PFz) as a percent of total force (%TF), vertical impulse (IFz, %TF) and time of occurrence of PFz (TPFz) as a percent of the stance phase (%SP) in the pads of all four limbs in 23 dogs with osteoarthritis in the elbow joint and 22 healthy dogs. Dogs walked over a pressure plate, and the pads were divided into four quadrants for VFD analysis. For statistical analysis, a general linear model was used to examine the difference in VFD between both groups, between fore- and hindlimbs, between body sides, and between medial/lateral and cranial/caudal quadrants. Lame dogs had lower PFz in the lame forelimb than in other limbs and transferred their weight to the caudal quadrants of the contralateral forelimb and the caudomedial quadrant of both hindlimbs. IFz was also lower in the affected forelimb and was compensated through higher loading of the caudal quadrants of the contralateral forelimb, the caudomedial quadrants of both hindlimbs and the caudolateral quadrant of the contralateral hindlimb. TPFz (%SP) occurred later in both forelimbs of the lame dogs than in those of healthy dogs. The analysis of force distribution over the paw quadrants can be used for further biomechanical studies of dogs with orthopaedic and neurological diseases.",

Therefore, we examined the effects of barley on the lifespan; behavioral phenotypes, such as locomotor activity, and cognitive functions, and intestinal microbiome in the senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mouse. We prepared two mild high-fat diets by adding lard, in which the starch components of AIN-93G were replaced by rice or barley ""Motchiriboshi."" SAMP8 (four weeks old, male) mice were fed AIN-93G until eight weeks old, and then rice (rice group) or barley diet (rice: barley = 1:4, barley group) until death. Changes in aging-related phenotypes, object and spatial recognition, locomotor and balancing activities, and the intestinal microbiome were recorded. Moreover, plasma cholesterol levels were analyzed at 16 weeks old. Barley intake prolonged the lifespan by approximately four weeks, delayed locomotor atrophy, and reduced balancing ability and spatial recognition. Barley intake significantly increased the medium and small particle sizes of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which is associated with a reduced risk of total stroke. The Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio in the barley group was significantly higher than that in the rice group during aging. Thus, lifelong barley intake may have positive effects on healthy aging.",
