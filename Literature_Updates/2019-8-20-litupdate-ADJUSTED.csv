Biomechanical studies have suggested that it should be considered concomitantly with the Hill-Sachs lesion as ""bipolar"" bone defects for assessing structural degradation, but the definitive number of instability events associated with the critical size has not been investigated."

One of the important reasons for this fracture is because it is the longest bone in the body and osteoporosis affect this part a lot. The geometric complexity and anisotropy properties of this bone have received a lot of attention in the orthopedic field.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) 5 on postmenopausal osteoporosis by regulating the biological behaviors of osteoblasts. Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomized to develop an osteoporosis model. A lentivirus packaging system was employed to generate lentiviruses capable of upregulating or downregulating the expression of ERK-5 in ovariectomized rats. The femoral biomechanical properties, bone mineral density (BMD), contents of Ca, P and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bone turnover markers in rats, as well as viability, cycle and apoptosis of osteoblasts and ALP activity in osteoblasts were measured in the ovariectomized rats so as to explore the functional significance of ERK-5 in postmenopausal osteoporosis. The femoral mechanical strength of ovariectomized rats was enhanced by overexpression of ERK-5. Meanwhile femoral BMD, and bone metabolism were increased, and bone turnover normalized in the ovariectomized rats when ERK-5 was overexpressed. Lentivirus-mediated ERK-5 overexpression in osteoblasts was observed to inhibit osteoblast apoptosis, and promote viability, accompanied with increased ALP activity. Taken together, ERK-5 could decelerate osteoblast apoptosis and improve postmenopausal osteoporosis by increasing osteoblast viability. Thus, our study provides further understanding on a promising therapeutic target for postmenopausal osteoporosis."

However, detailed molecular mechanism and therapeutic strategy for postmenopausal osteoporosis remains insufficient. Increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs contributed to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and could be considered as potential therapeutic targets. In this study, we found that miR‑151a-3p was upregulated in osteoporosis samples. Experiments in MC3T3-E1 cells indicated that miR‑151a-3p significantly inhibited cell viability and promotes LDH release, as well as increased RANKL/OPG ratio and decreased Runx2 and BMP2 expressions. SOCS5 was identified as a direct target gene of miR-151a-3p, which was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. Moreover, an inverse correlation between miR-151a-3p and SOCS5 was also observed in osteoporosis femurs. Additionally, JAK2/STAT3 pathway was founded to be involved in the progress of osteoporosis mediated by miR-151a-3p-SOCS5 axis. In vivo, ovariectomized rat model was established to simulate postmenopausal osteoporosis. The results revealed that miR-151a-3p significantly decreased the bone mineral density and biomechanical parameters of femurs in ovariectomized rats by targeting SOCS5, and that JAK2/STAT3 pathway is a downstream target for the role of miR-151a-3p-SOCS5 axis on ovariectomized rats. In conclusion, our findings suggested that miR-151a-3p contributed to the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis and promoted its progress by targeting SOCS5 and activating JAK2/STAT3 signaling. Thus, anti-miR-151a-3p could be a potential therapeutic strategy for postmenopausal osteoporosis."

The underlying pathophysiology of bone stress injuries is multifactorial. The present cross-sectional study investigated (1) cortical and trabecular bone microstructure as well as volumetric bone mineral density in subjects with bone stress injuries at the tibial diaphysis, measured at the distal tibia and the distal radius by means of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography, (2) areal bone mineral density using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry as well as calcaneal dual X-ray absorptiometry and laser, and (3) the influence on bone turnover markers of formation and resorption at the early phase after injury. A total of 26 Caucasian male professional soldiers with post-training bone stress injury at the tibial diaphysis were included (case group). A total of 50 male, Caucasian professional soldiers from the same military institution served as controls (control group). High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography revealed a higher total area at the radius within the case group. Cortical bone mineral density was reduced at the radius and tibia within the case group. Trabecular number and trabecular thickness were reduced at the tibia in the case group. The trabecular network was more inhomogeneous at the radius and tibia within the case group. Calcaneal dual X-ray absorptiometry and laser was significantly reduced in the case group. This study quantified differences in bone microstructure among otherwise healthy individuals. Differences in bone microarchitecture may impair the biomechanical properties by increasing the susceptibility to sustain bone stress injuries. This article is protected by copyright.

A total of 48 unilateral amputees who received an osseointegrated implant, comprising 33 trans-femoral amputees (TFA) and 15 trans-tibial amputees (TTA), underwent dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans of the lumbar spine (L2-L4) and femoral necks at baseline, one-year, and three-years follow-up. Mobility outcomes, including the Six Minute-Walk Test (6MWT) and Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG), were measured before surgery, at one-year, and more than two years following the osseointegration procedure. We observed a significant increase (p < 0.05) in Z-Score values in the femoral neck of the amputated side in TFA patients without a femoral neck lag screw at the one-year and three-year follow-ups, as well as in TFA patients with a lag screw present at three-years follow-up. BMD at one-year follow-up was found to be positively correlated with pre-surgery 6MWT values in patients who were mobile using a traditional socket prosthesis before receiving an osseointegrated implant. These results suggest that osseointegrated implants induce a physiological response in the femoral neck of recipients and appear to be evidence of restored biomechanical loading in the proximal femur.

However, the impact of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) on the aortic-mitral continuity and severity of mitral regurgitation (MR) are poorly understood. In this study, a comprehensive engineering analysis was performed to investigate the impact of TAVR on MR severity and left heart dynamics in a retrospective patient case who harbours bicuspid aortic valve stenosis and concomitant functional MR. The TAVR procedure was computer simulated using a balloon-expandable valve, and the impact of three implantation heights on aortic-mitral coupling, MR severity and device performance were analysed. The accuracy and predictability of the computer modelling framework were validated with pre- and post-operative echo data. The highest deployment model resulted in higher stresses in the native leaflets, contact radial force and stent recoil, while the midway implantation model gave better haemodynamic performance and MR reduction in this patient case. Although the regurgitant volume decreased (less than 10%) for the three deployment configurations, no significant differences in MR severity improvement and mitral leaflet tethering were found. Acute improvement in MR was (i) due to the mechanical compression of the stent against the aortic-mitral curtain, (ii) due to an immediate drop in the ventricular pressure and transmitral pressure gradient. Albeit a single real clinical case, it is our hope that such detailed engineering computational analysis could shed light on the underlying biomechanical mechanisms of TAVR impact on MR."

The maximum diameter criterion, typically used for aneurysm rupture risk estimations, has been challenged by more sophisticated biomechanically motivated models in the past. Although these models are very helpful for the clinicians in decision-making, they do not attempt to capture material failure. Following a short overview of the microstructure of the aorta, we analyze the failure mechanisms involved in the dissection and rupture by considering also traumatic rupture. We continue with a literature review of experimental studies relevant to quantify tissue strength. More specifically, we summarize more extensively uniaxial tensile, bulge inflation and peeling tests, and we also specify trouser, direct tension and in-plane shear tests. Finally we analyze biomechanically motivated models to predict rupture risk. Based on the findings of the reviewed studies and the rather large variations in tissue strength, we propose that an appropriate material failure criterion for aortic tissues should also reflect the microstructure in order to be effective."

Today, there are very few non-perturbative methods to quantify nuclear mechanical properties. Interferometric microscopy, also known as quantitative phase microscopy (QPM), is a powerful tool for studying red blood cell biomechanics. The existing QPM tools, however, have not been utilized to study biomechanics of complex eukaryotic cells either due to lack of depth sectioning, limited phase measurement sensitivity, or both. Here, we present depth-resolved confocal reflectance interferometric microscopy as the next generation QPM to study nuclear and plasma membrane biomechanics. The proposed system features multiple confocal scanning foci, affording 1.5 micron depth-resolution and millisecond frame rate. Furthermore, a near common-path interferometer enables quantifying nanometer-scale membrane fluctuations with better than 200 picometers sensitivity. Our results present accurate quantification of nucleic envelope and plasma membrane fluctuations in embryonic stem cells."

Despite drugs are used to treat the disease clinically, the influence of these drugs on leukemia cells' biomechanical properties, which are closely related to complications like leukostasis or infiltration, is still unclear. Due to non-adherent and viscoelastic nature of leukemia cells, accurate measurement of their elastic modulus is still a challenging issue. In this study, we adopted rate-jump method together with optical tweezers indentation to accurately measure elastic modulus of leukemia cells K562 after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), Cytoxan (CTX), and Dexamethasone (DEX) treatment, respectively. We found that compared to control sample, K562 cells treated by PMA showed nearly a threefold increase in elastic modulus. Transwell experiment results suggested that the K562 cells treated with PMA have the lowest migration capability. Besides, it was shown that the cytoskeleton protein gene α-tubulin and vimentin have a significant increase in expression after PMA treatment by qPCR. The results indicate that PMA has a significant influence on protein expression, stiffness, and migration ability of the leukemia cell K562, and may also play an important role in the leukostasis in leukemia."

Elevated IOP occurs as the result of impaired aqueous humor outflow. Both a passive model and a dynamic model have been used to explain trabecular outflow resistance. The passive model posits that the trabecular meshwork acts as a static filter that exerts stable and passive resistance to outflow. In contrast, the dynamic model involves a 'biomechanical pump.' In recent years, the range of surgical management options for glaucoma has dramatically expanded, particularly the class of procedures known as micro-invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS). These procedures typically target and enhance specific outflow routes. Optimal patient outcomes with MIGS require a clear understanding of aqueous outflow and a surgical approach that is targeted to overcome the site of abnormal resistance in the individual. We review the anatomy and physiology of trabecular and suprachoroidal outflow that is of relevance to MIGS surgeons."

It has been found in different multicellular species, from cephalopods to humans, but never in individual cells. Here we describe a motility pattern consistent with associative conditioned behavior in the microorganism Amoeba proteus. We use a controlled direct-current electric field as the conditioned stimulus, and a specific chemotactic peptide as the unconditioned stimulus. The amoebae are capable of linking two independent past events, generating persistent locomotion movements that can prevail for 44 min on average. We confirm a similar behavior in a related species, Metamoeba leningradensis. Thus, our results indicate that unicellular organisms can modify their behavior during migration by associative conditioning."

However, the quantitative measurements of pollen adhesion on biological surfaces have been poorly studied so far. We performed atomic force microscopy adhesion measurements of pollen on two most important floral parts for Asteraceae in a course of pollination: the stigma and style of Hypochaeris radicata plant. The results indicated distinct adhesive properties of them-the pollen adhesion on stigmatic surfaces drastically increased over prolonged contact time, while the pollen adhesion increase on stylar surfaces was rather restrained. Based on the observation with cryo-scanning electron microscopy, we explained the experimental results by the presence of morphological features in form of flexible stigmatic papillae that may play a crucial role in enhancing both capillary attraction and van der Waals forces. The distinct adhesive properties seemingly originate from the unique adhesive tasks that each of the floral parts requires to achieve successful pollination. The insights into the adhesive interaction between pollen and the floral parts, obtained in the present study, may lead to better understanding of pollination mechanisms, which are strongly related to our food production. Additionally, the novel pollen adhesive mechanisms learned from the stigma of the studied Asteraceae plant can inspire biomimetic designs of spontaneous gripping systems."

The ""omics"" revolution has propelled a new era in muscle research, allowing us to discern minute details of molecular cross-talk required for effective coordination between the myriad interacting components for efficient muscle function. The objective of this review is to provide a systems-level, comprehensive mapping the molecular mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle structure and function, in health and disease. We begin this review with a focus on molecular mechanisms underlying muscle tissue development (myogenesis), with an emphasis on satellite cells and muscle regeneration. We next review the molecular structure and mechanisms underlying the many structural components of the muscle: neuromuscular junction, sarcomere, cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix, and vasculature surrounding muscle. We highlight aberrant molecular mechanisms and their possible clinical or pathophysiological relevance. We particularly emphasize the impact of environmental stressors (inflammation and oxidative stress) in contributing to muscle pathophysiology including atrophy, hypertrophy, and fibrosis.

Here we characterized a density-responsive reporter system in transgenic Drosophila S2 cells. We show that the reporter genes are strongly induced in a cell density-dependent and reporter-independent fashion. The rapid and reversible induction occurs at the level of mRNA accumulation. We show that multiple DNA elements within the transgene sequences, including a metal response element from the metallothionein gene, contribute to the reporter induction. The reporter induction correlates with changes in multiple cell density and growth regulatory pathways including hypoxia, apoptosis, cell cycle and cytoskeletal organization. Potential applications of such a density-responsive reporter will be discussed."

The present study was designed to explore the in vivo-antioxidant potential and the probable mechanism of acid hydrolysates prepared from A. auricula polysaccharides (AAPHs-F) with the optimal acid hydrolysis conditions using Box-Behnken design, and C. elegans was used as a model organism. The effects of AAPHs-F on the locomotory behavior, lifespan, activities of antioxidant-related enzymes and levels of antioxidants in C. elegans were studied. In addition, the potential of AAPHs-F in up-regulating the expression of antioxidant-related genes in C. elegans, such as daf-16, skn-1, sod-1, sod-2 and sir-2.1, and the inhibition of cell apoptosis of C. elegans were also discussed. The results indicated that AAPHs-F could significantly increase the U-Turn frequency of nematodes, extend their lifespan, enhance antioxidant systems including superoxide dismutase (SOD) by 70.60%, catalase (CAT) by 73.45% and glutathione reductase (GR) by 258.68% (p < 0.01), increase the level of glutathione (GSH) by 110.22% (p < 0.01), and decrease the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) by 31.86% and 46.16% (p < 0.01), respectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) results showed that AAPHs-F could up-regulate mRNA expression levels of daf-16, skn-1, sir, sod-1 and sod-2 in wild-type C. elegans (>1.3 fold) when treated at a concentration of 0.1 mg mL-1 (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). AAPHs-F was concluded to be heteropolysaccharides composed of mannose, glucose and galactose with a molar ratio of 12.7 : 3.25 : 1. The molecular weight of AAPHs-F was determined to be 885.37 Da. Furthermore, AAPHs-F is mainly formed of (1 → 3)-linked-α-d-glucopyranose, and carboxyl or acetamide is present in the molecule. In summary, our studies provide evidence that AAPHs-F helps improve the antioxidant defense system, and up-regulation of stress and longevity related genes suggests the possible involvement of these genes in the prevention of stress damage in C. elegans."

Considering that the accumulation of MMA and MA causes several damages due to oxidative stress, antioxidants are thought to play a pivotal role in preventing deleterious effects associated with exposure to such compounds. Ilex paraguariensis (IP) was used here to test the hypothesis that supplementation with the aqueous extract of this plant could exert protective effect against MMA or MA induced mortality, behavioral and/or biochemical changes in Drosophila melanogaster (DM). Initially, a curve time- and dose-response to MMA (1-10 mM), MA (1-10 mM) and IP (63-500 μM) was performed. Thereafter, flies were concomitantly exposed to MA (5 mM), MMA (5 mM) and/or IP (250 μg/mL) during 15 days for survival assay, and for 48 hs to MA (1 or 5 mM), MMA (1 or 5 mM) and/or IP (250 μg/mL) for subsequent investigations. Both MMA and MA exposure resulted in higher incidence of mortality, a worse performance in the negative geotaxis assay and increased locomotion in open-field test as compared with control group. Furthermore, a marked increase in non-protein thiol (NPSH) and in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels, decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities, and decrease in MTT and resazurin reduction were noted in MMA or MA treated groups. IP treatment offered significant protection against all alterations associated to MMA or MA exposure. This study confirm the hypothesis that supplementation with IP offers protection against changes associated to MMA or MA exposure in DM, due, at least in part, to its antioxidant effect."

The extent and uses of ultrasonic communication remain poorly understood, potentially ranging from echolocation, advertisement of reproductive status and resource availability, social cohesion, to predator avoidance. Here, using active acoustics whereby the study subjects were observed throughout their activity period, we describe the first purely ultrasonic call from a strepsirrhine primate (family Lorisidae), recorded in a completely wild setting, and hypothesise about its function. We identified one type of ultrasonic call, the doublet click, from 14 Javan slow lorises (Nycticebus javanicus) produced by males and females of juvenile, subadult and adult ages within their social groups (n = 791, mean = 46.0 kHz). We ran quadratic discriminant function analysis, finding dominant frequency and doublet click duration as the key parameters for identifying individuals' sex and age. Significantly more vocalisations were produced during affiliative social behaviour, suggesting that the call serves a social cohesion function. Considering the range of other cryptic behaviours, including slow and silent locomotion, and the high degree of territoriality associated with venomous attacks on conspecifics, the call may also serve as a safety strategy, allowing family members to regulate distance from other slow lorises and to communicate cryptically whilst avoiding predators."

Of the 408 calculated coefficients, 71.6% showed significant linear correlations. Significant linear correlations were found between muscle activity, such as burst amplitudes and the integral of muscle activity, and the corresponding kinematic parameters of each joint. Most of these relationships were speed independent (91.7% of all variables). Through correlation analysis, this study demonstrated a causal association between kinematic and EMG patterns of rhesus monkey locomotion. Individuals have particular musculoskeletal control patterns, and most of the relationships between hindlimb segments and muscles are speed independent. The current findings may enhance our understanding of neuromusculoskeletal control strategies."

One mechanism for amplification involves muscle-tendon unit (MT) systems in which a spring element (SEE) is pre-stretched while held in place by a 'latch' that prevents immediate transmission of muscle (or contractile element, CE) power to the load. In principle, this storage phase is followed by a triggered release of the latch, and elastic energy released from the SEE enables power amplification (PRATIO=PLOAD/PCE,max >1.0), whereby the peak power delivered from MT to the load exceeds the maximum power limit of the CE in isolation. Latches enable power amplification by increasing the muscle work generated during storage and reducing the duration over which that stored energy is released to power a movement. Previously described biological 'latches' include: skeletal levers, anatomical triggers, accessory appendages and even antagonist muscles. In fact, many species that rely on high-powered movements also have a large number of muscles arranged in antagonist pairs. Here, we examine whether a decaying antagonist force (e.g., from a muscle) could be useful as an active latch to achieve controlled energy transmission and modulate peak output power. We developed a computer model of a frog hindlimb driven by a compliant MT. We simulated MT power generated against an inertial load in the presence of an antagonist force 'latch' (AFL) with relaxation time varying from very fast (10ms) to very slow (1000ms) to mirror physiological ranges of antagonist muscle. The fastest AFL produced power amplification (PRATIO =5.0) while the slowest AFL produced power attenuation (PRATIO =0.43). Notably, AFLs with relaxation times shorter than ∼300ms also yielded greater power amplification (PRATIO>1.20) than the system driving the same inertial load using only an agonist MT without any AFL. Thus, animals that utilize a sufficiently fast relaxing AFL ought to be capable of achieving greater power output than systems confined to a single agonist MT tuned for maximum PRATIO against the same load."

Developmental changes in muscle leverage could constitute one mechanism to promote increased performance in juveniles despite ontogenetic limitations. We tested this hypothesis using a holistic dataset on growth and locomotor development in wild eastern cottontail rabbits (<i>Sylvilagus floridanus</i>) to examine ontogenetic changes in hindlimb muscle effective mechanical advantage (EMA). EMA is a dimensionless index of muscle leverage, equal to the quotient of average muscle lever length and the load arm length of the ground reaction force (GRF), effectively representing the magnitude of output force arising from a given muscle force. We found that EMA at the hip and ankle joints, as well as overall hindlimb EMA, significantly declined across ontogeny in <i>S. floridanus</i>, whereas EMA at the knee joint remained unchanged. Ontogenetic decreases in EMA were due to isometric scaling of muscle lever arm lengths alongside positive ontogenetic allometry of GRF load arm lengths - which in turn was primarily related to positive allometry of hindlimb segment lengths. Greater EMA limits the estimated volume of hindlimb extensor muscle that has to be activated in young rabbits, likely mitigating the energetic cost of locomotion and saving metabolic resources for other physiological functions, such as growth and tissue differentiation. An additional examination of limb growth allometry across a diverse sample of mammalian taxa suggests that ontogenetic decreases in limb joint EMA may be a common mammalian trend."

Because high-frequency sounds are capable of travelling only short distances, their function is limited by the distance the sound can be discerned. One possible function for these short-distance, high-frequency sounds is that they might be used by the tarsiers to navigate throughout their environment. I conducted this study at Tangkoko Nature Reserve in Sulawesi, Indonesia, from May to August 2017. Using the focal follows, I recorded the start of each locomotor activity to the nearest second. I also simultaneously recorded all ultrasonic vocalisations that the focal individual emitted using a Wildlife Acoustics Ultrasonic Song Meter BAT3. Approximately 42% of the ultrasonic calls that I recorded during this study were given within 1 s prior to engaging in locomotor activity. The tarsiers gave statistically more ultrasonic calls during locomotion than during other behaviours (rest, forage and social). Four types of ultrasonic calls were given while locomoting: whistles, doubles, trills and frequency-modulated calls. Of these, the trill and the frequency-modulated call were only given during locomotion, and trills were only given prior to leaping. These results preliminarily suggest that the tarsiers do use ultrasonic calls for navigation. Studying echolocation in organisms closely related to bats is critical for understanding the evolution of echolocation."

Tuning can occur over generations and lead to genetic differences in innate foraging behavior or over shorter timescales within an individual's lifespan. Both genetically encoded and experience-based strategies are implemented by neural circuits that respond to environmental cues and track internal states. Caenorhabditis elegans exhibit both between-strain genetic differences and within-strain plasticity in foraging. In individuals, changes in foraging are usually short term and based on recent experience. Here, we tested whether developmental experience could permanently alter foraging. We found that, in most wild strains, early-life starvation led to ""cautious"" foraging strategies, in which exploration is reduced, and these behavioral changes are associated with altered dynamics in a locomotory circuit. Possessing either the derived (domestication-associated) or ancestral allele of the neuroglobin glb-5 determines foraging plasticity. Overall, we show that C. elegans exhibit adaptive developmental plasticity that affects multiple aspects of foraging behavior and leads to changes in a core navigation circuit and that innate foraging traits and plasticity in those traits are genetically separable."

For most intertidal organisms this small-scale heterogeneity in microclimates can have enormous influences on survival and physiological performance. However, the potential ecological importance of environmental heterogeneity in determining ecological responses to climate change remains poorly understood. We present a novel framework for generating spatially explicit models of microclimate heterogeneity and patterns of thermal physiology among interacting organisms. We used drone photogrammetry to create a topographic map (digital elevation model) at a resolution of 2 × 2 cm from an intertidal site in Massachusetts, which was then fed into to a model of incident solar radiation based on sky view factor and solar position. These data were in turn used to drive a heat budget model that estimated hourly surface temperatures over the course of a year (2017). Body temperature layers were then converted to thermal performance layers for organisms, using thermal performance curves, creating 'physiological landscapes' that display spatially and temporally explicit patterns of 'microrefugia'. Our framework shows how non-linear interactions between these layers lead to predictions about organismal performance and survivorship that are distinct from those made using any individual layer (e.g. topography, temperature) alone. We propose a new metric for quantifying the 'thermal roughness' of a site (RqT, the root mean square of spatial deviations in temperature), which can be used to quantify spatial and temporal variability in temperature and performance at the site level. These methods facilitate an exploration of the role of micro-topographic variability in driving organismal vulnerability to environmental change using both spatially explicit and frequency-based approaches."

However, the molecular mechanism that governs fuel selection in muscle is not well understood. Here, we report that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a fasting-induced myokine that controls metabolic reprograming through the AMPK/CREB/PGC-1α pathway in female mice. Female mice with a muscle-specific deficiency in BDNF (MBKO mice) were unable to switch the predominant fuel source from carbohydrates to fatty acids during fasting, which reduced ATP production in muscle. Fasting-induced muscle atrophy was also compromised in female MBKO mice, likely a result of autophagy inhibition. These mutant mice displayed myofiber necrosis, weaker muscle strength, reduced locomotion, and muscle-specific insulin resistance. Together, our results show that muscle-derived BDNF facilitates metabolic adaption during nutrient scarcity in a gender-specific manner and that insufficient BDNF production in skeletal muscle promotes the development of metabolic myopathies and insulin resistance."

The pro-social effects of oxytocin are well-documented and have generated much interest into its suitability as a therapeutic for disorders characterised by social dysfunction. This study investigated the social phenotype of mice with a targeted deletion of the gene for insulin-regulated aminopeptidase, an enzyme involved in the degradation of oxytocin and vasopressin. In the 3-chamber sociability test, a genotype effect was observed and subsequent post hoc analysis revealed that male, but not female, insulin-regulated aminopeptidase knockout mice made significantly more approaches to the enclosure holding a stranger mouse than did wildtype mice (p = 0.0039). Male insulin-regulated aminopeptidase knockout mice also displayed decreased rearing (t = 2.309, df = 24, p = 0.0299) and locomotor activity (t = 2.134, df = 24, p = 0.043) in the open field test, suggestive of a reduced stress response to a novel environment. Our findings provide support for the role of insulin-regulated aminopeptidase in influencing social behaviour, possibly via modulation of oxytocin and vasopressin levels. The increase in social interaction observed in the male, but not female, insulin-regulated aminopeptidase knockout mice is in agreement with reports of sex differences in effects of oxytocin and vasopressin on social behaviours and should be explored further."

While numerous walking simulations and robots have been constructed, no full-state walking controller for even a simple model of walking has been derived from human walking data. Here, to construct such a feedback controller, we applied thousands of unforeseen perturbations to subjects walking on a treadmill and collected data describing their recovery to normal walking. Using these data, we derived a linear controller to make the classical inverted pendulum model of walking respond to perturbations like a human. The walking model consists of a point-mass with two massless legs and can be controlled only through the appropriate placement of the foot and the push-off impulse applied along the trailing leg. We derived how this foot placement and push-off impulse are modulated in response to upper-body perturbations in various directions. This feedback-controlled biped recovers from perturbations in a manner qualitatively similar to human recovery. The biped can recover from perturbations over twenty times larger than deviations experienced during normal walking and the biped's stability is robust to uncertainties, specifically, large changes in body and feedback parameters."

Assistance strategies designed to keep the human ""in-the-loop"" can help overcome many of these challenges. The purpose of this study was to develop a human-in-theloop assistance strategy that uses co-adaptive control to slowly and continuously respond to biomechanical changes thought to encode the user's needs. Online measurements of muscle activity and joint kinematics were used to guide the evolution of an exoskeleton torque pattern based on the following heuristics: 1) muscle activity that acts cooperatively with the exoskeleton indicates the user wants more torque; 2) muscle activity that acts antagonistically to the exoskeleton indicates the user wants less torque; and 3) torque should stop increasing if the user is not adapting. We applied our controller to tethered, bilateral ankle exoskeletons worn by na(ve participants as they walked on a treadmill at 1.25 ms..1 for 30 minutes. The evolved torque profiles reduced the root-mean-square of soleus muscle activity by 35 ± 12% and metabolic rate by 22 ± 8% compared to walking with the exoskeletons while they provided no torque. This was equivalent to a 9 ± 12% reduction in metabolic rate when compared to normal walking. Furthermore, the algorithm was responsive to changes in each user's coordination patterns. These results confirm the effectiveness of the controller and suggest a new approach to exoskeleton assistance aimed at fostering co-adaptation with the user. This technique might particularly benefit individuals with age-related muscle weakness."

However, the effects of balance support through handrail holding on locomotor learning are unknown. Locomotor learning can be studied on split-belt treadmills, where participants walk on two parallel belts with asymmetric left and right belt speeds, to which they adapt their stepping pattern within a few minutes. The aim of this study was to determine how handrail holding affects the walking pattern during split-belt adaptation and after-effects in able-bodied persons. Fifty healthy young participants in five experimental groups were instructed to hold handrails, swing arms freely throughout the experiment or hold handrails during adaptation and swing arms freely during after-effects. Step length asymmetry and double support asymmetry were measured to assess the spatiotemporal walking pattern. The results showed that holding handrails during split-belt adaptation reduces magnitude of initial perturbation of step length asymmetry and reduces after-effects in step length asymmetry upon return to symmetric belt speeds. The findings of this study imply that balance support during gait training reduces locomotor learning, which should be considered in daily clinical gait practice and future research on locomotor learning."

Treatment options are limited because the pathologic mechanisms remain to be characterized. Dysregulation of the inflammatory cascade may lead to communication between myofibroblasts and immune cells triggering tissue metaplasia, and excessive collagen deposition described clinically as arthrofibrosis. We explored the novel use of celecoxib (selective COX-2 inhibitor) to disrupt the downstream effects of the post-traumatic inflammatory cascade and inhibit scar tissue formation in a validated rabbit model of arthrofibrosis combined with new parameters for quantifying the stiffness of the posterior capsule. Biomechanical and molecular analyses, of contracted rabbit knee posterior capsule tissue after COX-2 inhibition revealed increased maximal passive extension and down-regulation of collagen mRNA compared to controls. Histopathologic examination suggested a trend of decreased quantities of dense fibrous connective tissue with COX-2 inhibition. These data may suggest that inhibiting the inflammatory cascade could potentially reduce pathologic myofibroblast activation, thereby reducing scar tissue formation and increasing the range of motion in arthrofibrotic joints. Implementing a multi-modal pharmacologic approach may simultaneously target numerous cellular components contributing to the complex process of arthrofibrogenesis.

Automated studies of their locomotion are crucial to link sensory input and neural processing to motor output which has led to numerous vision-based tracking systems. However, most of these approaches share the inability to segment the contours of colliding animals causing identity losses, appearing and disappearing animals and the absence of posture and motion related measurements during the time of the collision. We present a novel collision resolution algorithm enabling an accurate contour segmentation of multiple touching Drosophila larvae. Our algorithm utilizes an adapted active shape model (ASM) to learn a low dimensional posture space which is fitted to random-walker generated pre-segmentations. We evaluate our collision resolution algorithm using three publicly available datasets and compare it with the current state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we introduce a refined dataset enabling a segmentation evaluation on the level of pixel accuracy. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and computational time. We will incorporate this algorithm into our widely used tracking program to improve the statistical strength of the behavioral quantification and allow marker-free studies of interacting Drosophila larvae."

Ultrasonography is a noninvasive method for imaging and evaluating the condition of the abdominal organs. The aim of the present study was to establish a novel method for evaluating small intestinal motility by using ultrasonography in mice. We measured GI motility with and without loperamide, an antidiarrheal medication, by intestinal transit using an orally administered dye, a <sup>13</sup>C-octanoic acid breath test, and ultrasonography. Locomotion activity of the duodenal wall was used for quantifying the GI motility observed via ultrasonography. Our results showed that upper GI transit was significantly delayed by loperamide. The <sup>13</sup>C-octanoic acid breath test revealed decreased gastric emptying in loperamide-treated mice. Through ultrasonography, large peristaltic movements were observed in the duodenum of the control mice. In contrast, after treatment with loperamide, these peristaltic movements were suppressed, and the duodenal lumen was enlarged, suggesting decreased duodenal motility. In accordance with these results, quantifiable locomotion activity was also significantly decreased. In conclusion, ultrasonography is an effective in vivo method to quantify small intestinal motility in mice."

Although this scheme is helpful for extracting common control principles underlying various types of animal locomotion, there remains further room for improvement of its design. Specifically, while the previous works assumed that the action term is given by a sinusoidal function, it is expected that introducing higher Fourier harmonics in the action term improves locomotion performance.

Using tissue-specific rescue of fahd-1(-) worms, we find that these phenotypic abnormalities are at least in part due to fahd-1's function in neurons. Moreover, we show that egg-laying defects in fahd-1(-) worms can be fully rescued by external dopamine administration and that depletion of fahd-1 expression induces expression of several enzymes involved in serotonin biosynthesis. Together, our results support a role for fahd-1 in modulating serotonin levels and suggest this protein as a novel link between metabolism and neurotransmitter signaling in the nervous system. Finally, we propose a model to explain how a metabolic defect could ultimately lead to marked changes in neuronal signaling."

Of the four mammalian <i>Mef2</i> genes, <i>Mef2d</i> is highly expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, a region critical for coordinating peripheral circadian clocks. Utilizing both conventional and brain-specific <i>Mef2d</i> knockout (<i>Mef2d<sup>-/-</sup></i> ) mouse lines, we demonstrate that MEF2D is essential for maintaining the length of the circadian free-running period of locomotor activity and normal sleep patterns in male mice. Crossing <i>Mef2d<sup>-/-</sup></i> with <i>Per2::luc</i> reporter mice, we show that these behavioral changes are achieved without altering the endogenous period of the master circadian oscillator in the SCN. Together, our data suggest that alterations in behavior in <i>Mef2d<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice may be the result of an effect on SCN output, rather than an effect on timekeeping within the SCN itself. These findings add to the growing body of evidence that MEF2 proteins play important roles in the brain.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b>These studies are the first to show a role for MEF2 proteins in the brain outside of the hippocampus, and our findings suggest that these proteins may play diverse roles in the central nervous system. It is important to continue to build on our understanding of the roles of proteins acting in the SCN, because SCN dysfunction underlies jet lag in humans and influences the response to shift work schedules, which are now known as risk factors for the development of cancer. Our work on MEF2D could be the basis for opening new lines of research in the development and regulation of circadian rhythms."

Patients who survive pneumonia are vulnerable to long-term complications including increased risk of neurocognitive dysfunction. This study investigated the immune response and long-term complications of a non-surgical mouse model of Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumosepsis with antibiotic treatment. Pneumosepsis resulted in acutely enhanced expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and damage associated molecular patterns in the brain and spleen. Despite resolution of infection, murine pneumosepsis survivors demonstrated a deficit in exploratory locomotor behavior at two weeks. This was associated with brain specific persistent inflammatory gene expression and infiltrating myeloid cells in the brain. The brain inflammatory response was also primed in response to secondary challenge with lipopolysaccharide. The findings of this study demonstrate behavioral and inflammatory outcomes that parallel observations in other models of sepsis, but that have not previously been described in antibiotic treated pneumonia models, highlighting a common pathway to the development of chronic brain dysfunction in sepsis survival."

In succession to previous investigations in our laboratory on morphine dependence and our research on acquisition and expression phases of morphine-conditioned place preference (CPP), in this study we attempt to determine the effects of intraaccumbal administration of SCH-23390, as a D1-like receptor antagonist, and sulpiride, as a D2-like receptor antagonist, in the maintenance of morphine-induced CPP in rats. Seventy-nine adult male Wistar rats weighing 200-280 g were bilaterally implanted with cannulas into the nucleus accumbens. During the 3-day conditioning phase, the animals received daily subcutaneous administration of morphine (5 mg/kg). CPP score and locomotor activity of animals were recorded by Ethovision software. Different doses (0.25, 1, 4 μg per 0.5 μL vehicle) of D1- and D2-like antagonists were bilateral injected daily after the expression phase and during the extinction phase. Our findings revealed that intraaccumbal administration of D1-like and D2-like antagonists after the CPP test shortened the extinction phase in the rats. The results suggested that the existence of the dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens was important for the maintenance of morphine-rewarding properties during the extinction phase. Therefore, dopamine receptors may be considered as a promising therapeutic agent in preventing the maintenance of morphine-rewarding effects in dependent individuals.

The orexinergic terminals innervate neurons of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) which is a key structure in the maintenance and reinstatement of drug addiction. However, the specific contribution of intra-DG orexin receptors to stress-induced reinstatement has not been completely known. In the current study, the effects of intra-DG administration of SB334867, an orexin-1 receptor (OX1R) antagonist, and TCS OX2 29, an orexin-2 receptor (OX2R) antagonist, were investigated on the reinstatement induced by a sub-threshold dose of morphine and food deprivation (FD) stress. Adult male rats received different doses of SB334867 or TCS OX2 29 (3, 10, and 30 nM/0.5 µl DMSO 12%) bilaterally into the DG in separate groups, following the acquisition and extinction of morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). Then, the reinstatement was evaluated by the 24 h FD stress and/or a sub-threshold dose of morphine (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.). CPP scores and locomotor activities were recorded during the test. The findings indicated that pre-treatment with the highest dose of SB334867 (30 nM) and two higher doses of TCS OX2 29 (10 and 30 nM) blocked the sub-threshold dose and FD stress-induced reinstatement of morphine. The effect of TCS OX2 29 on reduction of reinstatement was more pronounced than that of SB334867. It suggests a role for the orexin receptors, especially OX2R within the DG region in the stress-induced reinstatement of morphine-seeking behaviours in extinguished rats."

Symptoms include treatment-refractory epilepsy, cognitive impairment, autistic-like behavior, and premature death. The specific loci of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 function in the brain that underlie these global deficits remain unknown. Here we specifically deleted <i>Scn1a</i> in the hippocampus using the Cre-Lox method in weanling mice.

Our results show that local gene deletion in the hippocampus can induce two of the most severe dysfunctions of Dravet Syndrome: Epilepsy and cognitive deficit. Considering these results, the hippocampus may be a potential target for future gene therapy for Dravet Syndrome."

It is important to find alternative therapies for the prevention of IFNα induced depression. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been useful in depressive disorder. Therefore the effects of celecoxib, ibuprofen, and indomethacin were evaluated following IFNα-induced depression in mice. Methods Male albino mice weighing 26 ± 2 g were used. Depression was induced by IFNα (16 × 105 IU/kg, SC) for six consecutive days. Animals were first subject to the locomotor test, then the splash test and finally the forced swimming test (FST) on the 7th day. The NSAIDs were administered (IP) either one single dose before the test, or simultaneously with IFNα. Results locomotor activity was only impaired by ibuprofen high dose (75 mg/kg), thus it was not further evaluated. Following IFNα therapy depression-like behaviors were observed; significant changes during the splash test (grooming time 24 ± 7 sec vs. control 63 ± 7 sec), the FST (immobility time 166  ± 15 sec vs. control 128  ± 6 sec), and sucrose preference reduced to 64 ± 0.8%. The NSAIDs noticeably reduced the immobility time in FST, while grooming time was increased. Celecoxib and indomethacin single doses were effective while ibuprofen showed better antidepressant effects when it was administered along with IFNα. Conclusions The NSAIDs were able to prevent IFNα induced depression in mice. NSAIDs administration with IFNα does not interfere with clinical benefit effects of IFNα and they could also be useful to prevent IFNα psychiatric side effects, thus further clinical trials are suggested."

Regardless of where in the brain behavior patterns arise, the central nervous system sends projections to motor neurons, which in turn project to and control temporally appropriate muscle contractions; thus, motor neurons are traditionally considered the last relay from the central nervous system to muscles. However, in an array of species and motor systems, an accumulating body of evidence supports a more complex role of motor neurons in pattern generation. These studies suggest that motor neurons not only relay motor patterns to the periphery, but directly contribute to pattern generation by providing feedback to upstream circuitry. In spinal and hindbrain circuits in a variety of animals - including flies, worms, leeches, crustaceans, rodents, birds, fish, amphibians and mammals - studies have indicated a crucial role for motor neuron feedback in maintaining normal behavior patterns dictated by the activity of a central pattern generator. Hence, in this Review, we discuss literature examining the role of motor neuron feedback across many taxa and behaviors, and set out to determine the prevalence of motor neuron participation in motor circuits."

Substantial evidence suggests that maternal protein malnutrition contributes to the progression of neurocognitive abnormalities and psychopathologies in adolescence and adulthood in offspring. Maternal malnutrition is prevalent in low and middle resource populations. The present study was therefore undertaken to evaluate the effects of dietary Spirulina supplementation of protein malnourished mothers during pregnancy and lactation on their offspring's reflex, neurobehavioral and cognitive development. Spirulina is a Cyanobacterium and a major source of protein and is being used extensively as a dynamic nutraceutical against aging and neurodegeneration. Sprague Dawley rats were switched to low protein (8% protein) or normal protein (20% protein) diet for 15 days before conception. Spirulina was orally administered (400 mg/kg/b.wt.) to subgroups of pregnant females from the day of conception throughout the lactational period. We examined several parameters including reproductive performance of dams, physical development, postnatal reflex ontogeny, locomotor behavior, neuromuscular strength, anxiety, anhedonic behavior, cognitive abilities and microglia populations in the F1 progeny. The study showed improved reproductive performance of Spirulina supplemented protein malnourished dams, accelerated acquisition of neurological reflexes, better physical appearance, enhanced neuromuscular strength, improved spatial learning and memory and partly normalized PMN induced hyperactivity, anxiolytic and anhedonic behavior in offspring. These beneficial effects of Spirulina consumption were also accompanied by reduced microglial activation which might assist in restoring the behavioral and cognitive skills in protein malnourished F1 rats. Maternal Spirulina supplementation is therefore proposed as an economical nutraceutical/supplement to combat malnutrition associated behavioral and cognitive deficits."

MSG-treated mice were examined behaviourally and histologically in relation to some features of AD. Four-week old mice received 5 subcutaneous MSG (2 g/kg) injections on alternate days, or saline. At age 10-12 weeks, they were given a battery of behavioural tests for species-typical behaviours and working memory. The mice were killed at 12 weeks and the brains excised. Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein was assessed in cortical and hippocampal neurons by immunohistochemistry, and in cerebral cortical homogenates. A 78% increase in cortical concentrations of phosphorylated tau protein was observed in the MSG mice. Intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau immunostaining was observed diffusely in the cortex and hippocampus, together with cortical atrophic neurons, extensive vacuolation and dysmorphic neuropil suggestive of spongiform neurodegeneration. Nest-building was significantly impaired, and spontaneous T-maze alternation was reduced, suggesting defective short-term working memory. Subcutaneous MSG treatment also induced a 56% reduction in exploratory head dips in a holeboard (P = 0.009), and a non-significant tendency for decreased burrowing behaviour (P = 0.085). These effects occurred in the absence of MSG-induced obesity or gross locomotor deficits. The findings point to subcutaneous MSG administration in early life as a cause of tau pathology and compromised species-typical behaviour in rodents. Determining whether MSG can be useful in modelling AD requires further studies of longer duration and full behavioural characterization."

However, the underlying mechanisms that induce high EI/BW in juvenile animals remain unknown. The EI from a control diet (CD) and high fat diet (HFD), as well as BW changes were compared between juvenile (3 weeks old) and adult (8 weeks old) rats. BW gain and EI were increased in the HFD-fed adult rats compared to the CD-fed adult rats. However, in the juvenile rats, there were no differences in BW gain and EI between the CD-fed and HFD-fed groups. The locomotor activity was significantly increased in HFD group compared with the CD group in juvenile, but not in adult rats. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons in the VTA were found to remain undeveloped with less GABAergic input into dopamine neurons in the juvenile rats. The deletion of the VTA GABA neurons in the adult rats significantly increased CD consumption, but showed almost no change in HFD consumption. These data suggest that undeveloped properties of VTA GABA neurons in juvenile rats can promote higher EI regardless of high or less palatable feeding, and contribute to growth promotion."

While exploring, they analyze peripheral stimuli distributed over several whiskers. Previous studies have reported cross-whisker integration of information at several levels of the neuronal pathways from whisker follicles to the somatosensory cortex. Here, we have investigated the possible coupling between whiskers at a preneuronal level, transmitted by the skin and muscles between follicles. First, we have quantified the movement induced on one whisker by deflecting another whisker. Our results show significant mechanical coupling, predominantly when a given whisker's caudal neighbor in the same row is deflected. The magnitude of the effect was correlated with the diameter of the deflected whisker. In addition to changes in whisker angle, we observed curvature changes when the whisker shaft was constrained distally from the base. Second, we found that trigeminal ganglion neurons innervating a given whisker follicle fire action potentials in response to high-magnitude deflections of an adjacent whisker. This functional coupling also shows a bias towards the caudal neighbor located in the same row. Finally, we designed a two-whisker biomechanical model to investigate transmission of forces across follicles. Analysis of the whisker-follicle contact forces suggests that activation of mechanoreceptors in the ring sinus region could account for our electrophysiological results. The model can fully explain the observed caudal bias by the gradient in whisker diameter, with possible contribution of the intrinsic muscles connecting follicles. Overall, our study demonstrates the functional relevance of mechanical coupling on early information processing in the whisker system."

Morphine exposure modifies the excitability and functional interactions between neurons, while the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, especially how morphine assembles heterogeneous interneurons (INs) in prelimbic cortex (PrL) to mediate disinhibition and reward, are not clear. Using approaches of optogenetics, electrophysiology, and cell type-specific RNA-seq, we show that morphine attenuates the inhibitory synaptic transmission from parvalbumin<sup>+</sup> (PV)-INs onto pyramidal neurons in PrL via μ-opioid receptor (MOR) in PV-INs. Meanwhile, morphine enhances the inhibitory inputs from somatostatin<sup>+</sup> (SST)-INs onto PV-INs, and thus disinhibits pyramidal neurons via δ-opioid receptor (DOR)-dependent Rac1 upregulation in SST-INs. We show that MOR in PV-INs is required for morphine-induced behavioral sensitization, while DOR as well as Rac1 activity in SST-INs is required for morphine-induced conditioned place preference and hyper-locomotion. These results reveal that SST- and PV-INs, functioning in PrL as a disinhibitory architecture, are coordinated by morphine via different opioid receptors to disinhibit pyramidal neurons and enhance reward."

We previously found that adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) activation dampens ethanol-drinking behaviors in equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) knockout mice, and A2AR inhibition augments reward-seeking behavior in wild-type mice. The novel adenosine analog N6-(4-hydroxybenzyl)-adenosine (NHBA) which is isolated from the rhizomes of Gastrodia elata activates A2AR and inhibits ENT1.

Elevating cAMP promotes CNS neuron growth in the presence of growth-inhibiting molecules. cAMP's effects on neuron growth is partly mediated by Epac, comprising Epac1 and Epac2 - the latter predominantly expresses in postnatal neural tissue. Here, we hypothesized that Epac2 activation would enhance axonal outgrowth after SCI. Using <i>in vitro</i> assays, we demonstrated for the first time that Epac2 activation using a specific soluble agonist (S-220) significantly enhanced neurite outgrowth of postnatal rat cortical neurons and markedly overcame the inhibition by chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans and mature astrocytes on neuron growth. We further investigated the novel potential of Epac2 activation in promoting axonal outgrowth by an <i>ex vivo</i> rat model of SCI mimicking post-SCI environment <i>in vivo</i> and by delivering S-220 via a self-assembling Fmoc-based hydrogel that has suitable properties for SCI repair. We demonstrated that S-220 significantly enhanced axonal outgrowth across the lesion gaps in the organotypic spinal cord slices, compared with controls. Furthermore, we elucidated for the first time that Epac2 activation profoundly modulated the lesion environment by reducing astrocyte/microglial activation and transforming astrocytes into elongated morphology that guided outgrowing axons. Finally, we showed that S-220, when delivered by the gel at 3 weeks after contusion SCI in male adult rats, resulted in significantly better locomotor performance for up to 4 weeks post-treatment. Our data demonstrate a promising therapeutic potential of S-220 in SCI, via beneficial effects on neurons and glia post-injury to facilitate axonal outgrowth.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b>During development, neuronal cAMP levels decrease significantly compared to the embryonic stage when the nervous system is established. This has important consequences following spinal cord injury (SCI), as neurons fail to regrow. Elevating cAMP levels encourages injured CNS neurons to sprout and extend neurites. We have demonstrated that activating its downstream effector, Epac2, enhances neurite outgrowth <i>in vitro,</i> even in the presence of an inhibitory environment. Using a novel biomaterial-based drug delivery system in the form of a hydrogel to achieve local delivery of an Epac2 agonist, we further demonstrated that specific activation of Epac2 enhances axonal outgrowth and minimizes glial activation in an <i>ex vivo</i> model of SCI, suggesting a new strategy for spinal cord repair."

Our iterative drug discovery program identified R-N-(1,2-dihydroxypropyl)-2,6-cis-di-(4-methoxyphenethyl)piperidine hydrochloride (GZ-793A), a selective vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2) inhibitor that specifically decreased methamphetamine's behavioral effects. However, GZ-793A inhibited human hERG channels, suggesting cardiotoxicity and prohibiting clinical development. The current study determined if replacement of the piperidine ring in GZ-793A with a phenylalkyl group to provide S-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-(1-phenylpropan-2-yl)propan-1-amine (GZ-11608), diminished hERG interaction while retaining pharmacological efficacy. VMAT2 inhibition, target selectivity and mechanism of GZ-11608-induced inhibition of methamphetamine-evoked vesicular DA release were determined. GZ-11608 doses that decreased methamphetamine-sensitized activity were used to evaluate potential exacerbation of methamphetamine-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity. GZ-11608-induced decreases in methamphetamine reinforcement and abuse liability were determined using self-administration, reinstatement and substitution assays. Results show that GZ-11608 exhibited high affinity (Ki=25 nM) and selectivity (92-1180-fold) for VMAT2 over nicotinic receptors, the dopamine transporter and hERG, suggesting low side-effect potential. GZ-11608 (EC50=620 nM) released vesicular dopamine 25-fold less potently than it inhibited VMAT2 dopamine uptake. GZ-11608 competitively inhibited methamphetamine-evoked vesicular dopamine release (Schild regression slope=0.9±0.13). GZ-11608 decreased methamphetamine-sensitized activity, without altering striatal dopamine content or exacerbating methamphetamine-induced dopamine depletion, revealing efficacy without neurotoxicity. GZ-11608 decreased methamphetamine self-administration, which was not surmounted by increasing methamphetamine unit doses. GZ-11608 reduced cue- and methamphetamine-induced reinstatement, suggesting its potential to prevent relapse. GZ-11608 neither served as a reinforcer nor substituted for methamphetamine, suggesting low abuse liability. Thus, GZ-11608, a potent and selective VMAT2 inhibitor, shows promise as a therapeutic for methamphetamine use disorder. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: GZ-11608 is a potent and selective vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2) inhibitor that decreases methamphetamine-induced dopamine release from isolated synaptic vesicles from brain dopaminergic neurons. Results from behavioral studies show that GZ-11608 specifically decreases methamphetamine sensitized locomotor activity, methamphetamine self-administration, and reinstatement of methamphetamine seeking behavior, without exhibiting abuse liability. Tolerance does not develop to the efficacy of GZ-11608 to decrease the behavioral effects of methamphetamine. In conclusion, GZ-11608 is an outstanding lead in our search for a therapeutic to treat methamphetamine use disorder."

Study objectives were to quantify spine loads during simulated fireground operations using simple (polynomial) and advanced (EMG-assisted musculoskeletal model) methods, and to describe the variation in spine loads between performers (N = 20). Spine compression forces differed by as much as 5.5 times bodyweight between individuals performing identical tasks. Anteroposterior and mediolateral shear forces varied by as much 3.2 and 2.1 times bodyweight between individuals performing the same tasks, respectively. Large variations in spine load magnitudes were documented regardless of whether simple or advanced quantification methods were used. Results suggest that low-back loading demands on the fireground would vary widely depending on the physical characteristics of individual firefighters, movement strategies employed, and tasks performed. Thus, personalized ergonomic interventions are warranted to regulate spine loading and load tolerance in firefighters. <b>Practitioner Summary:</b> Even when performing the same work, the associated spine loading demands will vary widely across people due to differences in their body sizes, shapes, and movement strategies. Therefore, personalized interventions are needed to regulate spine loading and load tolerance in workers (e.g., obesity prevention, physical capacity-building exercise, and movement [re]training)."

The specimens were cyclically loaded 500 times at 5 to 30 N, and central, peripheral, and total gap distance were measured. After completing cyclic load testing, the specimens were loaded to failure. Double vertical sutures demonstrated significantly lower total and central gap displacement than cross and double horizontal sutures (P<.05). However, there was no significant difference in peripheral gap formation within each group (P=.53). Ultimate failure load and stiffness were significantly greater for double vertical sutures (146.3 N) than for cross (113.8 N) and double horizontal sutures (107.2 N) (P<.05). Stiffness also was significantly increased for double vertical sutures (14.6 N/mm) compared with cross (11.3 N/mm) and double horizontal sutures (10.7 N/mm) (P<.05). There was no significant difference in biomechanical properties between cross and double horizontal sutures. Double vertical sutures showed superior mechanical properties compared with cross and double horizontal sutures in repair of radial meniscal tears, especially in the central zone. These biomechanical properties should be considered when determining appropriate rehabilitation protocols for each suture technique. [Orthopedics. 201x; xx(x):xx-xx.]."

A second measure, co-information, quantifies the net redundancy in global and local control. We first validate that our measures predict centralization in simulations of phase-coupled oscillators. We then test how centralization changes with speed in freely running cockroaches. Surprisingly, across all speeds centralization is constant and muscle activity is more informative of the global kinematic state (the averages of all legs) than the local state of that muscle's leg. Finally we use a legged robot to show that mechanical coupling alone can change the centralization of legged locomotion. The results of these systems span a design space of centralization and co-information for biological and robotic systems."

As an alternative, tensegrity structures have the essential characteristics of deformability, adaptability to the environment, and impact resistance. This article proposes ways to solve the problem of adaptive locomotion on complex terrain based on a tensegrity structure and shows that this approach is particularly useful. On the basis of the locomotion mechanism and morphological structure of the human foot, a structural mapping model of a tetrahedral mast tensegrity structure is established through bionic mapping. A model of an adaptive foot mechanism is established through bioinspired design. Theoretical calculations of the behavior of the mechanism are derived, and the spring stiffnesses are matched. A theoretical method based on mechanical kinematics is presented, and a kinematic solution is realized through inverse kinematics. In addition, the locomotion of the mechanism, which is similar to that of the human foot, is simulated using ADAMS, and the effectiveness of the proposed theory and design method is verified by comparing the simulation output with the theoretically calculated results. Finally, a physical prototype manufactured using three-dimensional printing technology is used to experimentally verify the functional characteristics of the terrain-adaptive locomotion of the proposed mechanism. The results show that the proposed adaptive bioinspired foot mechanism exhibits good stability in an unstructured environment and can mimic the adaptive locomotion characteristics of the human foot on complex terrain remarkably well."

Therefore, the purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of eccentric phase duration on concentric outcomes at 60% and 80% of one-repetition maximum (1RM) in the squat and bench press. Sixteen college-aged, resistance-trained males completed 1RM testing, established normative eccentric durations, and performed fast (0.75 times normative) and slow (2.0 times normative) metronome-controlled eccentric duration repetitions. Outcome measures assessed during the concentric phase were: average concentric velocity (ACV), peak concentric velocity (PCV), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), range of motion (ROM), and barbell path. Eccentric duration was significantly and inversely correlated with ACV at 60% (<i>r</i> = -0.408, p = 0.004) and 80% (<i>r</i> = -0.477, p = 0.001) of 1RM squat.

In vitro orthopaedic biomechanical testing for the elucidation of ACL integrity doesn't have an established testing paradigm to simulate the clinical pivot shift exam on cadaveric specimens. The study aim was to develop a robotically simulated pivot shift that represents the clinical exam. An orthopaedic surgeon performed a pivot shift on an instrumented ACL-deficient cadaver leg to capture 6 degree-of-freedom motion/loads. The same knee was mounted to the robot and the sensitivity of the motion/loading profiles quantified. Three loading profile candidates that generated positive pivot shifts on the instrumented knee were selected and applied to 7 ACL-intact/deficient specimens and resulted in the identification of a profile that was able to induce a positive pivot shift in all ACL-deficient specimens (p < 0.001). The simulated shifts began at 22±8° and ended at 33±6° of flexion with the average magnitude of the shifts being 12.8 ± 3.2 mm in anterior tibial translation and 17.6 ± 4.3° in external tibial rotation. The establishment and replication of a robotically simulated clinical pivot shift across multiple specimens shows the robustness of the loading profile to accommodate anatomical and experimental variability. Further evaluation and refinement should be undertaken to create a useful tool in evaluating ACL function and reconstruction techniques. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

In tendon, ECM provides overall tissue architecture, which is tailored to match the biomechanical requirements of their physiological function, i.e. force transmission from muscle to bone. Tendon ECM also constitutes the microenvironment that allows tendon resident cells to maintain their phenotype and that transmits biomechanical forces from the macro-level to the micro-level. The structure and function of adult tendons is largely determined by the hierarchical organization of collagen type I fibrils. However, non-collagenous ECM proteins such as small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs), ADAMTS proteases, and cross-linking enzymes play critical roles in collagen fibrillogenesis and guide the hierarchical bundling of collagen fibrils into tendon fascicles. Other non-collagenous ECM proteins such as the less abundant collagens, fibrillins, or elastin, contribute to tendon formation or determine some of their biomechanical properties. The interfascicular matrix or endotenon and the outer layer of tendons, the epi- and paratenon, includes collagens and non-collagenous ECM proteins, but their function is less well understood. The ECM proteins in the epi- and paratenon may provide the appropriate microenvironment to maintain the identity of distinct tendon cell populations that are thought to play a role during repair processes after injury. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the role of non-collagenous ECM proteins and less abundant collagens in tendon development and homeostasis. This article is protected by copyright.

short term influences radiation musculofascial healing laparotomy rat model,TISSUE/BIOMATERIAL,67.7% TISSUE/BIOMATERIAL; 9.7% BONE; 7.9% TENDON/LIGAMENT,"Chen Y, Zhang Q, Wu Y, Branch-Brooks CD, Butler CE,",*Scientific reports*,* [Short-term influences of radiation on musculofascial healing in a laparotomy rat model.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31417127),Short-term influences of radiation on musculofascial healing in a laparotomy rat model.,"Preoperative radiation is associated with an increased risk of wound complications. However, the influences of radiation on musculofascial wound healing remains unclear. The purpose of the study was to investigate the short-term effects of preoperative local radiation on the musculofascial healing of laparotomy incisions in a rat model. Eighteen Fischer 344 rats received radiation doses of 0, 10, or 20 Gy to the abdominal wall and underwent laparotomy 4 weeks later. Two weeks after laparotomy, samples of irradiated muscle were harvested for mechanical tests, histological (Hematoxylin & Eosin, and Masson's Trichrome) and immunohistochemical analyses using KI67, CD31, TGF-β, and MYOD1 antibodies. The elastic modulus (EM), maximum strain (MS), and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) in the 20-Gy group were significantly weaker than those in the 0-Gy group. The EM and UTS in the 20-Gy group were significantly lower than those in the 10-Gy group. The UTS and MS in the 10-Gy group were significantly lower than those in the 0-Gy group. The mean number of inflammatory cells per mm<sup>2</sup> in the 20-Gy group was significantly larger than those in the 10- and 0-Gy groups. The mean numbers of CD31-, KI67-, and MYOD1-positive cells, the optical density of TGF-β, and the microvessel density in the 20-Gy group were significantly smaller than those in the 10- and 0-Gy groups. These results indicated that radiation delays musculofascial healing and decreases mechanical strength of the laparotomy incision by creating a chronic inflammatory environment, inhibiting cell proliferation, angiogenesis, granulation maturation, collagen deposition, and muscular regeneration in a dose-dependent manner. The impaired biomechanical, histological and molecular properties may be associated with the higher risk of wound complications in patients who undergo radiotherapy prior to laparotomy."

Tissue engineering has become a promising approach for repairing such large tissue injuries including critical size bone defects. Three-dimension (3D) porous scaffolds based on piezoelectric polymers like poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) have received a lot of attention in bone tissue engineering due to their favorable osteogenic properties. Owing to the favourable redox properties, titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) nanostructures have gained a great deal of attention in bone tissue engineering. In this paper, tissue engineering scaffolds based on P(VDF-TrFE) loaded with TiO<sub>2</sub> nanowires (TNW) were developed and evaluated for bone tissue engineering. Wet-chemical method was used for the synthesis of TNW. Obtained TNW were thoroughly characterized for the physicochemical and morphological properties using techniques such as X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Electrospinning was used to produce TNW incorporated P(VDF-TrFE) scaffolds. Developed scaffolds were characterized by state of art techniques such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), XRD and Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses. TEM analysis revealed that the obtained TiO<sub>2</sub> nanostructures possess nanofibrous morphology with an average diameter of 26 ± 4 nm. Results of characterization of nanocomposite scaffolds confirmed the effective loading of TNW in P(VDF-TrFE) matrix. Fabricated P(VDF-TrFE)/TNW scaffolds possessed good mechanical strength and cytocompatibility. Osteoblast like cells showed higher adhesion and proliferation on the nanocomposite scaffolds. This investigation revealed that the developed P(VDF-TrFE) scaffolds containing TNW can be used as potential scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications."

We investigated age, sex, and genetic differences of Japanese Black calves in relation to frequency of play behaviors (galloping, leaping, turning, bucking, head butting objects, and head shaking) and examined how these relationships might affect growth during the suckling stage. Locomotor play behaviors (galloping, leaping, turning, and bucking) and head butting objects gradually declined with the age for both sexes. The frequency of head butting was significantly higher in males than females. We found that significant interaction effects (age × MAOA polymorphism) in play behaviors (except head shaking) and the frequencies of locomotor play in calves without the wild-type allele were significantly higher than those in younger calves (2 and 6 weeks of age). Weight gain was significantly correlated with the frequency of locomotor play in females, but not in males. This study suggests that play in Japanese Black calves gradually declines as they mature and that play may be controlled by variations in the MAOA gene. In addition, the frequency of locomotor play may be an indicator of health in female calves."

Appropriate convalescence and acclimation are important for animal experiments, because environmental changes and physical burden can result from surgery, transportation, and cage exchange. However, the duration that locomotor activity is affected by these factors is currently unclear, because it has traditionally been difficult to measure locomotor activity in multiple group-housed animals in any location other than the analysis room. In the present study, we analyzed the locomotor activity of group-housed rats using a nano tag<sup>®</sup> after surgery, transportation, and cage exchange. The nano tag<sup>®</sup>, a new device for analyzing activity, can measure locomotor activity in laboratory animals with no limitation on the number of animals in same cage. Any type of cage can be used for analysis, at any time of day, and in any location. Nano tags<sup>®</sup> were subcutaneously implanted in male rats (F344/NSlc, 6 weeks of age) and locomotor activity was continuously measured after surgery, transportation, and cage exchange. Significant activity changes were observed in rats after transportation and cage exchange, 9 days and 3 h after the event, respectively. The results suggest that continuous measurement of locomotor activity with nano tags<sup>®</sup> can be used to monitor changes in activity induced by environmental changes, and will be helpful for designing animal experiments analyzing locomotor activity."
