Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), sex hormones, adiponectin, and sclerostin are involved in the regulation of bone turnover but little is known about their role in the promotion of hepatic osteodystrophy. Endogenous opioids are reported to increase during cholestasis and may influence bone resorption. The purpose of this study was to investigate the circulating levels of these factors and their expression in the femur of bile duct ligated (BDL) rats, to evaluate the biomechanical bone strength, and the effect of naltrexone (NTX)."

However, impact sports during adolescence, leading to bone growth retardation and/or bone quality improvement, remains unexplained. This study investigated the effects of in vivo low (LI), medium (MI), and high (HI) impact loadings applied during puberty on bone growth, morphometry and biomechanics using a rat model. 4-week old rats (n = 30) were divided into control, sham, LI, MI, and HI groups. The impact was applied on the right tibiae, 5 days/week for 8 weeks mimicking walking (450 µε), uphill running (850 µε) and jumping (1250 µε) conditions. Trabecular and cortical parameters were determined by micro-CT, bone growth rate by calcein labeling and toluidine blue staining followed by histomorphometry. Bio-mechanical properties were evaluated from bending tests. HI group reduced rat body weight and food consumption compared to shams. Bone growth rate also decreased in MI and HI groups despite developing thicker hypertrophic and proliferative zone heights. HI group showed significant increment in bone mineral density, trabecular thickness, cortical and total surface area. Ultimate load and stiffness were also increased in MI and HI groups. We conclude that impact loading during adolescence reduces bone growth moderately but improves bone quality and biomechanics at the end of the growing period."

Recently, it has been reported that an appropriate level of calcium can alleviate fluorosis. However, the appropriate concentration and mechanism of calcium addition is unclear. Hence, we evaluated the histopathology and ultrastructure, DNA fragmentation, hormonal imbalances, biomechanical levels, and expression of apoptosis-related genes after treating the rats with 150 mg/L NaF and different concentrations of CaCO<sub>3</sub>. Our results suggested that NaF induced the histopathological and ultrastructural injury, with a concomitant increase in the DNA fragmentation (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and serum OC (17.5 ± 0.89 pmoL/L) at 120 days. In addition, the qRT-PCR and western blotting results indicated that NaF exposure upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of Bax, Calpain, Caspase 12, Caspase 9, Caspase 7, Caspase 3, CAD, PARP, and AIF while downregulated Bcl-2 (<i>P</i> < 0.01) and decreased the bone ultimate load by 27.1%, the ultimate stress by 10.1%, and the ultimate deformity by 23.3% at 120 days. However, 1% CaCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation decreased the serum OC (14.7 ± 0.65 pmoL/L), bone F content (<i>P</i> < 0.01), and fracture and breakage of collagen fibers and changed the expression of endoplasmic reticulum pathway-related genes and proteins at 120 days. Further, 1% CaCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation increased the bone ultimate load by 20.9%, the ultimate stress by 4.89%, and the ultimate deformity by 21.6%. In summary, we conclude that 1% CaCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation alleviated fluoride-induced bone damage by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction."

Although the models typically assign material properties based only on local bone mineral density (BMD), the mechanical behavior of trabecular bone also depends on fabric. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of incorporating measurements of fabric on the accuracy of FE predictions of vertebral deformation. Accuracy was assessed by using displacement fields measured via digital volume correlation-applied to time-lapse microcomputed tomography (μCT)-as the gold standard. Two QCT-based FE models were generated from human L1 vertebrae (n = 11): the entire vertebral body and a cuboid-shaped portion of the trabecular centrum [dimensions: (20-30) × (15-20) × (15-20) mm<sup>3</sup>]. For axial compression boundary conditions, there was no difference (p = 0.40) in the accuracy of the FE-computed displacements for models using material properties based on local values of BMD versus those using material properties based on local values of fabric and volume fraction. However, when using BMD-based material properties, errors were higher for the vertebral-body models (8.4-50.1%) than cuboid models (1.5-19.6%), suggesting that these properties are inaccurate in the peripheral regions of the centrum. Errors also increased when assuming that the cuboid region experienced uniaxial loading during axial compression of the vertebra. These findings indicate that a BMD-based constitutive model is not sufficient for the peripheral region of the vertebral body when seeking accurate QCT-based FE modeling of the vertebra."

Since only the physiologically loaded states of the aorta are given from in vivo clinical images, inverse approaches, which take into account of the unloaded configuration, are needed for in vivo material parameter identification. Existing inverse methods are computationally expensive, which take days to weeks to complete for a single patient, inhibiting fast feedback for clinicians. Moreover, the current inverse methods have only been evaluated using synthetic data. In this study, we improved our recently developed multi-resolution direct search (MRDS) approach and the computation time cost was reduced to 1~2 hours. Using the improved MRDS approach, we estimated in vivo aortic tissue elastic properties of two ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA) patients from pre-operative gated CT scans. For comparison, corresponding surgically-resected aortic wall tissue samples were obtained and subjected to planar biaxial tests. Relatively close matches were achieved for the in vivo-identified and ex vivo-fitted stress-stretch responses. It is hoped that further development of this inverse approach can enable an accurate identification of the in vivo material parameters from in vivo image data."

This study sought to identify stretch-responsive pathways involved in cardiac development. microRNA (miRNA)-Sequencing identified miR-486 as being increased in cardiomyocytes exposed to cyclic stretch in vitro (63%, p<0.002). The right ventricles of HLHS patients experience increased stretch and have a trend towards higher miR-486 levels 4.9-fold (p=0.08). Sheep RVs dilated from excessive pulmonary blood flow have 60% more miR-486 vs. control RVs (p<0.05). The left ventricles of newborn mice treated with miR-486 mimic are 16.9%-24.6% larger (p<0.01) and display 2.48 fold increase in cardiomyocyte proliferation (p<0.01). miR-486 treatment decreases FoxO1 and Smad signaling, while increasing the protein levels of Stat1. Stat1 associates with Gata4 and Serum Response Factor (Srf), two key cardiac transcription factors whose protein levels increase in response to miR-486. This is the first report of a stretch-responsive miRNA that increases the growth of the ventricle in vivo."

The current study quantifies the elements responsible for aortic compliance, namely, elastin, collagen and smooth muscle cells, using histological and stereological techniques on human tissue with a focus on regional heterogeneity. Using donated cadaveric tissue, a series of samples were excised between the proximal ascending aorta and the distal abdominal aorta, for five cadavers, each of which underwent various staining procedures to enhance specific constituents of the wall. Using polarised light microscopy techniques, the orientation of collagen fibres was studied for each location and each tunical layer of the aorta. Significant transmural and longitudinal heterogeneity in collagen fibre orientations were uncovered throughout the vessel. It is shown that a von Mises mixture model is required accurately to fit the complex collagen fibre distributions that exist along the aorta. Additionally, collagen and smooth muscle cell density was observed to increase with increasing distance from the heart, whereas elastin density decreased. Evidence clearly demonstrates that the aorta is a highly heterogeneous vessel which cannot be simplistically represented by a single compliance value. The quantification and fitting of the regional aortic bioarchitectural data, although not without its limitations, including mean cohort age of 77.6 years, facilitates the development of next-generation finite element models that can potentially simulate the influence of regional aortic composition and microstructure on vessel biomechanics."

The coaptation of these leaflets during the cardiac cycle facilitates unidirectional blood flow. Valve regurgitation is treated preferably by surgical repair if possible or replacement based on the disease state of the valve tissue. A comprehensive understanding of valvular morphology and mechanical properties is crucial to refining computational models, serving as a patient-specific diagnostic and surgical tool for preoperative planning. Previous studies have modeled the stress distribution throughout the leaflet's thickness, but validations with layer-specific biaxial mechanical experiments are missing. In this study, we sought to fill this gap in literature by investigating the impact of microstructure constituents on mechanical behavior throughout the thickness of the AHVs' anterior leaflets. Porcine mitral valve anterior leaflets (MVAL) and tricuspid valve anterior leaflets (TVAL) were micro-dissected into three layers (atrialis/spongiosa, fibrosa, and ventricular) and two layers (atrialis/spongiosa and fibrosa/ventricularis), respectively, based on their relative distributions of extracellular matrix components as quantified by histological analyses: collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans. Our results suggest that (i) for both valves, the atrialis/spongiosa layer is the most extensible and anisotropic layer, possibly due to its relatively low collagen content as compared to other layers, (ii) the intact TVAL response is stiffer than the atrialis/spongiosa layer but more compliant than the fibrosa/ventricularis layer, and (iii) the MVAL fibrosa and ventricularis layers behave nearly isotropic. These novel findings emphasize the biomechanical variances throughout the AHV leaflets, and our results could better inform future AHV computational model developments. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study, which is the first of its kind for atrioventricular heart valve (AHV) leaflet tissue layers, rendered a mechanical characterization of the biaxial mechanical properties and distributions of extracellular matrix components (collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans) of the mitral and tricuspid valve anterior leaflet layers. The novel findings from the present study emphasize the biomechanical variances throughout the thickness of AHV leaflets, and our results indicate that the previously-adopted homogenous leaflet in the AHV biomechanical modeling may be an oversimplification of the complex leaflet anatomy. Such improvement in the understanding of valvular morphology and tissue mechanics is crucial to future refinement of AHV computational models, serving as a patient-specific diagnostic and surgical tool, at the preoperative stage, for treating valvular heart diseases."

IVF was carried to obtain pups, which were allowed to grow to the age of eight weeks. Thereafter, male mice were subjected to 20 minutes of global ischemia and 24 hours of reperfusion. The mice obtained from other groups including normal mating; superovulation, but normal mating and normal mating, but embryo implantation were also subjected to global ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. IVF-derived mice exhibited significant more injury in response to I/R injury in comparison to other groups assessed in terms of impairment in locomotor activity, development of motor in coordination, neurological severity score, cerebral infarction, apoptosis markers (caspase-3 activity and Bcl-2 expression). Moreover, there was a relative decrease in the brain levels of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) and its biosynthetic enzymes viz. cystathionine-β-synthase and cystathionine-γ-lyase. Interestingly, the levels of H<sub>2</sub>S and cystathionine-γ-lyase were significantly low in IVF-derived mice in basal conditions also i.e. before subjecting to I/R injury and these biochemical alterations were associated with the behavioral deficits in mice, even before subjecting to I/R injury. It is concluded that i<i>n vitro</i> fertilization-derived mice are more susceptible to global cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury, which may be possibly due to decreased levels of hydrogen sulfide and its biosynthetic enzymes viz., cystathionine-β-synthase and cystathionine-γ-lyase."

In the heart, the growth of the myocardium is tightly coupled to that of the endocardium, a specialized endothelial tissue that lines its interior. Several molecular pathways have been implicated in the communication between these tissues including secreted factors, components of the extracellular matrix, or proteins involved in cell-cell communication. Yet, it is unknown how the growth of the endocardium is coordinated with that of the myocardium. Here, we show that an increased expansion of the myocardial atrial chamber volume generates higher junctional forces within endocardial cells. This leads to biomechanical signaling involving VE-cadherin, triggering nuclear localization of the Hippo pathway transcriptional regulator Yap1 and endocardial proliferation. Our work suggests that the growth of the endocardium results from myocardial chamber volume expansion and ends when the tension on the tissue is relaxed."

Although mechanical stimulation such as stretching has significant effects on the prevention and treatment of diseases, its influence on nuclear morphology and/or intranuclear functions involving resistance to DNA damage remains unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of mechanical stimulation by cyclic stretching on nuclear morphology and resistance of DNA to UV damage in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Adherent cells on silicone elastic membranes were subjected to ~ 10% cyclic uniaxial stretch at a frequency of 0.5 Hz for 12 h. As a result, the intracellular actin cytoskeleton and nucleus were found to be elongated and aligned in the direction of zero normal strain (~ 62° with respect to the stretch direction) in an actomyosin tension-dependent manner. The nuclei of the stretched cells were dramatically compressed by the reorganized actin stress fibers located on their apical and both sides, and a significant increase in the intranuclear DNA density was observed. Intercellular tension, as assessed with live cell atomic force microscopy imaging, also increased following exposure to cyclic stretch. The UV radiation-induced DNA damage, estimated from the fluorescence intensity of the phospho-histone γ-H2AX, significantly decreased in these stretched cells. These results indicate that the cyclic stretch-induced morphological changes in the nucleus may improve the UV radiation resistance of cells, probably owing to the intracellular force-induced condensation of chromatin. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the inhibition of the UV radiation-induced DNA damage by mechanical stimulation."

WS is caused by mutations in WRN, a RecQ helicase that has essential roles responding to DNA damage and preventing genomic instability. While human WRN has both an exonuclease and helicase domain, Drosophila WRNexo has high genetic and functional homology to only the exonuclease domain of WRN. Like WRN-deficient human cells, Drosophila WRNexo null mutants (WRNexo<sup>Δ</sup>) are sensitive to replication stress, demonstrating mechanistic similarities between these two models. Compared to age-matched wild-type controls, WRNexo<sup>Δ</sup> flies exhibit increased physiological signs of aging, such as shorter lifespans, higher tumor incidence, muscle degeneration, reduced climbing ability, altered behavior, and reduced locomotor activity. Interestingly, these effects are more pronounced in females suggesting sex-specific differences in the role of WRNexo in aging. This and future mechanistic studies will contribute to our knowledge in linking faulty DNA repair mechanisms with the process of aging."

Extracapsular extension requires invasion within and through a smooth muscle-structured environment. Because integrins respond to biomechanical cues, we used a gene editing approach to determine if a specific region of laminin-binding α6β1 integrin was required for smooth muscle invasion both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Human tissue specimens showed prostate cancer invasion through smooth muscle and tumor coexpression of α6 integrin and E-cadherin in a cell-cell location and α6 integrin in a cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) distribution. Prostate cancer cells expressing α6 integrin (DU145 α6WT) produced a 3D invasive network on laminin-containing Matrigel and invaded into smooth muscle both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. In contrast, cells without α6 integrin (DU145 α6KO) and cells expressing an integrin mutant (DU145 α6AA) did not produce invasive networks, could not invade muscle both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, and surprisingly formed 3D cohesive clusters. Using electric cell-substrate impedance testing, cohesive clusters had up to a 30-fold increase in normalized resistance at 400 Hz (cell-cell impedance) as compared with the DU145 α6WT cells. In contrast, measurements at 40,000 Hz (cell-ECM coverage) showed that DU145 α6AA cells were two-fold decreased in normalized resistance and were defective in restoring resistance after a 1 μmol/L S1P challenge as compared with the DU145 α6WT cells. The results suggest that gene editing of a specific α6 integrin extracellular region, not required for normal tissue function, can generate a new biophysical cancer phenotype unable to invade the muscle, presenting a new therapeutic strategy for metastasis prevention in prostate cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows an innovative strategy to block prostate cancer metastasis and invasion in the muscle through gene editing of a specific α6 integrin extracellular region."

In this study, we focused on an osmotic engine model, which is a migration mechanism, and applied it as a negative chemotaxis mechanism to induce liposome displacement. First, we confirmed the osmotic flow across the lipid bilayer and calculated the osmotic flow velocity to be 8.5 fL min-1 μm-2 when a salt concentration difference was applied to the lipid bilayer. Next, we designed and fabricated a microchannel that can trap a giant liposome and apply a salt concentration difference to the front and rear of the liposome. Then, we demonstrated the movement of the liposome by flowing it to the microchannel. The liposome successfully moved in the direction of the lower ion concentration at a speed of 0.6 μm min-1 owing to the osmotic pressure difference. Finally, we visualized the inner flow in the liposome by encapsulating microbeads in the liposome and observed the movement of the microbeads to verify that an osmotic flow was generated on the liposome. As a result, we observed the circulation of the microbeads in the liposome when the concentration difference was applied to the front and rear of the liposome, suggesting that the movement of the liposome was driven by the osmotic flow generated by the osmotic pressure difference.

Many of the neurological disorders, including cerebral stroke have sex-specific characteristics. Deciphering the differential molecular mechanisms of sex-specific recovery from hypoxic-ischemic insult can improve medical practice in the treatment of cerebral stroke. In the present study, we describe the establishment of a sex-specific global hypoxia-ischemia neural damage and repair model in zebrafish. During hypoxic exposure a delayed behavioural response was observed in female fish that resumed normal swimming pattern earlier than their male counterparts. Moreover, female appeared more affected as they showed restricted locomotor and exploratory behaviour in novel tank test, reduced mitochondrial enzyme activity, enhanced DNA damage, and cell death after hypoxia insult. However, they showed a faster recovery as compared to male. Analysis of mRNA and protein expression levels of some characteristic hypoxic-ischemic markers showed notable sex-specific differences. Using zebrafish model, we have uncovered cellular and molecular differences in sex-specific systemic responses during the post-hypoxia recovery. This insight might help in devising better therapeutic strategy for stroke in female patients."

Graviola (Annona muricata), a small tree of the Annonaceae family, has been investigated for its protective effects against diabetic complications, oxidative stress, and neuropathies. This study was planned to investigate the effects of graviola on behavioural alterations and testicular oxidative status of streptozotocin (STZ; 65 mg/kg)-induced diabetic rats. Forty adult male Wistar rats were equally allocated into four groups: control (received normal saline 8 ml/kg orally once daily), diabetic (received normal saline orally once daily), graviola (GR; received 100 mg/kg/day; orally once daily), and diabetic with graviola (Diabetic+GR; received 100 mg/kg/day; once daily). Behavioural functions were assessed using standard behavioural paradigms. Also, oxidative statuses of testis were evaluated. Results of behavioural observations showed that diabetes induced depression-like behaviours, reduction of exploratory and locomotor activities, decreased memory performance, and increased stress-linked behaviours. These variations in diabetic rats were happened due to oxidative stress. Interestingly, treatment of diabetic rats with graviola for four weeks alleviated all behavioural changes due to diabetes. Also, rats in graviola-treated groups had greater testicular testosterone and estradiol levels compared with diabetic rats due to significant rise in testicular acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 2 expression. In the same context, graviola enhanced the antioxidant status of testicular tissues by significantly restoring the testicular glutathione and total superoxide dismutase that fell during diabetes. In addition, Graviola significantly decreased the expression of apoptotic (Bax) and inflammatory (interleukin-1β) testicular genes. In conclusion, these data propose that both the hypoglycemic and antioxidative potential of graviola are possible mechanisms that improve behavioural alterations and protect testis in diabetic animals. Concomitantly, further clinical studies in human are required to validate the current study."

The limbs are often cooler than the core at rest, but because the large locomotor muscles of the limbs produce heat during exercise, they are thought to operate at or above core temperature during activity. Bats, small-bodied flying mammals with greatly elongated forelimbs, possess wings with large surfaces lacking any insulating fur. We hypothesized that during flight the relatively small muscles that move the elbow and wrist operate below core body temperature because of elevated heat loss. We measured muscle temperature continuously in the small fruit bat <i>Carollia perspicillata</i> before and during wind tunnel flights, and discretely in diverse bats at rest in Belize. We found that bats maintained high rectal temperatures, but that there was a steep proximal-to-distal gradient in wing muscle temperature. Forearm muscles were 4-6°C cooler than rectal temperature at rest and approximately 12°C cooler during flights at an air temperature of 22°C. These findings invite further study into how bats and other endotherms maintain locomotor performance in variable environments, when some muscles may be operating at low temperatures that are expected to slow contractile properties."

However, concentrations tested in most studies are often much higher than the ones potentially identified in the environment. Therefore, such toxicity limits the application of these studies to evaluate ecotoxicological risks posed by these nanopollutants. Thus, the aim of the current study is to evaluate the impacts of ZnO NPs (at environmentally relevant concentrations - 760 μg/L and 76,000 μg/L, for 72 h) on the behavioral responses of Oreochromis niloticus (Nile tilapia) exposed to it. Results did not evidence harmful effects of NPs on animals' locomotor abilities (evaluated through open-field and light-dark transition tests), or anxiety-predictive behavior. On the other hand, Zn bioaccumulation in the body tissues of the analyzed tilapias was correlated to changes in eating behavior (motivated by ration pellets), as well as to deficits in antipredatory defensive behavior (under individual and collective conditions). Tilapia exposed to ZnO NPs recorded lower avoidance, flight and territorialist behavior rates when they were individually confronted with potential predators (Salminus brasiliensis). However, collectively exposed animals were unable to recognize their predators, as well as to differentiate them from artificial baits (""false predators""). The present study is the first to report biological impacts resulting from the short exposure of fish-group representatives to ZnO NPs. Thus, we believe that it may be relevant to improve the knowledge about ecotoxicological risks posed by these pollutants."

Much has been learned about the timing, physiology and genetics of diapause in a range of insects, but how the multiple changes involved in this and other photoperiodically regulated traits are interrelated is not well understood. We performed quasinatural selection on reproduction under short photoperiods in a northern fly species, <i>Drosophila montana</i>, to trace the effects of photoperiodic selection on traits regulated by the photoperiodic timer and / or by a circadian clock system. Selection changed several traits associated with reproductive diapause, including the critical day length for diapause (CDL), the frequency of diapausing females under photoperiods that deviate from daily 24 h cycles and cold tolerance, towards the phenotypes typical of lower latitudes. However, selection had no effect on the period of free-running locomotor activity rhythm regulated by the circadian clock in fly brain. At a genomic level, selection induced extensive divergence between the selection and control line replicates in 16 gene clusters involved in signal transduction, membrane properties, immunologlobulins and development. These changes resembled ones detected between latitudinally divergent <i>D. montana</i> populations in the wild and involved SNP divergence associated with several genes linked with diapause induction. Overall, our study shows that photoperiodic selection for reproduction under short photoperiods affects diapause-associated traits without disrupting the central clock network generating circadian rhythms in fly locomor activity."

We tested the hypothesis that ageing influences the scope for phenotypic flexibility in the mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus), an amphibious fish that transitions between two vastly different environments, water and land. We found that older fish (4-6 years old) exhibited marked signs of ageing; older fish were reproductively senescent, had reduced fin regenerative capacity and body condition, and exhibited atrophy of both oxidative and glycolytic muscle fibers relative to younger adult fish (1-2 years old). However, age did not affect routine O<sub>2</sub> consumption. We then acclimated adult fish (1-6 years) to water (control) or air for 10 days to assess the scope for phenotypic flexibility in response to terrestrial exposure. In support of our hypothesis, we found that older air-acclimated fish had a diminished scope for gill remodeling relative to younger fish. We also found that older fish exhibited poorer terrestrial locomotor performance relative to younger adult fish, particularly when acclimated to air. Our results indicate that ageing diminishes skeletal muscle integrity and locomotor performance of amphibious fishes, and may, therefore, impair terrestrial foraging ability, predator avoidance, or dispersal across the terrestrial environment. Remarkably, older fish voluntarily left water to a similar degree as younger fish despite the age-related deterioration of traits important for terrestrial life."

In order to stay airborne, its flexible hindwings are flapped so as to work as a thrust generator. However, the wing loading of the beetle is relatively large (38.94  ±  3.73 N m<sup>-2</sup>) compared to those of other insects and hummingbirds, indicating that it is challenging for it to achieve flight. Here, we measured the hindwing morphology and kinematics of the beetle in order to discover its flight performance. Unlike many other insects, the beetle flaps its hindwings with an extremely large sweep amplitude of about 191.33  ±  6.12 deg at high flapping frequencies ranging from 36 to 41 Hz (mean wing tip speed  ≈  13.45  ±  0.58 m s<sup>-1</sup>). These capabilities enable the beetle to produce enough lift force to stay airborne with its bulky body (4-10 g). In order to investigate how the sweep amplitude affects the beetle's flight efficiency, we utilized the unsteady blade element model to estimate the power requirements of the same vertical force production for various sweep amplitudes. The results indicate that the sweep amplitude as high as 190 deg is more beneficial for power requirements than the smaller amplitudes, which require higher frequencies resulting in higher inertial powers to produce the same vertical force. Thus, for this large beetle, high sweep amplitude may be a biological strategy for staying airborne. In addition, we thoroughly discussed the effects of input constraints on the outcome by investigating power loadings for variable sweep amplitudes at a constant vertical force, mean wing tip speed, and flapping frequency. Effect of wing surface area was also investigated and discussed to provide useful information for the development of an insect-inspired flapping-wing robot."

This study investigated the effects of early-life exposure to pulsed long term evolution (LTE) 1,846 MHz downlink signals on innate mouse behavior. Animals were exposed for 30 min/day, 5 days/week at a whole-body average specific energy absorption rate (SAR) of 0.5 or 1 W/kg from late pregnancy (gestation day 13.5) to weaning (postnatal day 21). A behavioral tracking system measured locomotor, drinking, and feeding behavior in the home cage from 12 to 28 weeks of age. The exposure caused significant effects on both appetitive behaviors and activity of offspring that depended on the SAR. Compared with sham-exposed controls, exposure at 0.5 W/kg significantly decreased drinking frequency (P ≤ 0.000) and significantly decreased distance moved (P ≤ 0.001). In contrast, exposure at 1 W/kg significantly increased drinking frequency (P ≤ 0.001) and significantly increased moving duration (P ≤ 0.005). In the absence of other plausible explanations, it is concluded that repeated exposure to low-level RF fields in early life may have a persistent and long-term effect on adult behavior.

Obtaining live individuals for in vivo bite-force measurements or freshly deceased specimens for bite force modeling is challenging for many species. Thomason's dry skull method for mammals relies solely on osteological specimens and, therefore, presents an advantageous approach that enables researchers to estimate and compare bite forces across extant and even extinct species. However, how accurately the dry skull method estimates physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of the jaw adductor muscles and theoretical bite force has rarely been tested. Here, we use an ontogenetic series of southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) to test the hypothesis that skeletomuscular traits estimated from the dry skull method accurately predicts test traits derived from dissection-based biomechanical modeling. Although variables from these two methods exhibited strong positive relationships across ontogeny, we found that the dry skull method overestimates PCSA of the masseter and underestimates PCSA of the temporalis. Jaw adductor in-levers for both jaw muscles and overall bite force are overestimated. Surprisingly, we reveal that sexual dimorphism in craniomandibular shape affects temporalis PCSA estimations; the dry skull method predicted female temporalis PCSA well but underestimates male temporalis PCSA across ontogeny. These results highlight the importance of accounting for sexual dimorphism and other intraspecific variation when using the dry skull method. Together, we found the dry skull method provides an underestimation of bite force over ontogeny and that the underlying anatomical components driving bite force may be misrepresented."

This is because to date there has been no efficient method for quantification and statistical analysis of enamel complexity. Our study proposes to apply a method previously developed for quantification of 3D tooth cusp morphology to the problem of quantifying microstructural enamel complexity. Here, we use image compression ratio (ICR) as a proxy variable for enamel complexity in 2D enamel photomicrographs taken using circularly polarized transmitted light microscopy. ICR describes the relationship between a digital image captured in an uncompressed file format and the identical image that has had its file size compressed using computer algorithms; more complex images receive less compression. In our analyses, ICR analysis is able to distinguish between images of teeth with simple, radial enamel and teeth with complex decussating enamel. Moreover, our results show a significant correlation between ICR and enamel complexity ranks assigned via visual assessment. Therefore, our results demonstrate that ICR analysis provides a viable methodology for efficient comparison of overall enamel complexity among dental samples. This article is protected by copyright.

However, despite the diversity of dietary niches that characterizes the superfamily Musteloidea, the masticatory muscle fiber architecture of its members has yet to be investigated anatomically. In this study, we present myological data from the jaw adductors in combination with biomechanical data derived from craniomandibular measurements for 17 species representing all four families (Ailuridae, Mephitidae, Mustelidae, and Procyonidae) of Musteloid. These data are combined to calculate bite force potential at each of three bite points along the dental row. Across our sample as a whole, masticatory muscle mass scaled with isometry or slight positive allometry against both body mass and skull size (measured via a cranial geometric mean). Total jaw adductor physiological cross-sectional area scaled with positive allometry against both body mass and skull size, while weighted fiber length scaled with negative allometry. From a dietary perspective, fiber length is strongly correlated with dietary size such that taxa that exploit larger foods demonstrated myological adaptations toward gape maximization. However, no consistent relationship between bite force potential and dietary mechanical resistance was observed. These trends confirm previous findings observed within the carnivoran family Felidae (as well as within primates), suggesting that the mechanisms by which masticatory anatomy adapts to dietary ecology may be more universally consistent than previously recognized.

More frequent maternal touch is linked to greater activity and connectivity strength in social brain regions, and increases children's attention to and learning of faces. It has been theorized that touch may prime children for social interactions and set them on a path towards healthy social cognitive development. However, less is known about the effects of touch on young infants' psychological development, especially in the newborn period, a highly sensitive period of transition with rapid growth in sensory and social processing. It remains untested whether newborns can distinguish CT-targeted touch from other types of touch, or whether there are benefits of touch for newborns' social, emotional, or cognitive development. In the present study, we experimentally investigated the acute effects of touch in newborn monkeys, a common model for human social development. Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), like humans, are highly social, have complex mother-infant interactions with frequent body contact for the first weeks of life, making them an excellent model of infant sociality. Infant monkeys in the present study were reared in a neonatal nursery, enabling control over their early environment, including all caregiver interactions. One-week-old macaque infants (N = 27) participated in three 5-minute counter-balanced caregiver interactions, all with mutual gaze: stroking head and shoulders (CT-targeted touch), stroking palms of hands and soles of feet (Non-CT touch), or no stroking (No-touch). Immediately following the interaction, infants watched social and nonsocial videos and picture arrays including faces and objects, while we tracked their visual attention with remote eye tracking. We found that, during the caregiver interactions, infants behaved differently while being touched compared to the no-touch condition, irrespective of the body part touched. Most notably, in both touch conditions, infants exhibited fewer stress-related behaviors-self-scratching, locomotion, and contact time with a comfort object-compared to when they were not touched. Following CT-targeted touch, infants were faster to orient to the picture arrays compared to the other interaction conditions, suggesting CT-targeted touch may activate or prime infants' attentional orienting system. In the No-touch condition infants attended longer to the nonsocial compared to the social video, possibly reflecting a baseline preference for nonsocial stimuli. In contrast, in both touch conditions, infants' looked equally to the social and nonsocial videos, suggesting that touch may influence the types of visual stimuli that hold infants' attention. Collectively, our results reveal that newborn macaques responded positively to touch, and touch appeared to influence some aspects of their subsequent attention, although we found limited evidence that these effects are mediated by CT fibers. These findings suggest that newborn touch may broadly support infants' psychological development, and may have early evolutionary roots, shared across primates. This study illustrates the unique insight offered by nonhuman primates for exploring early infant social touch, revealing that touch may positively affect emotional and attentional development as early as the newborn period."

Understanding the soft tissue composition of modern species can aid in understanding changes in musculoskeletal features through evolution, including those pertaining to locomotion. Establishing anatomical differences in soft tissues utilising an extant phylogenetic bracket can, in turn, assist in interpreting morphological changes in hard tissues and modelling musculoskeletal movements during evolutionary transitions (e.g. digit reduction in perissodactyls). Perissodactyls (horses, rhinoceroses, tapirs and their relatives) are known to have originated with a four-toed (tetradactyl) forelimb condition. Equids proceeded to reduce all but their central digit, resulting in monodactyly, whereas tapirs retained the ancestral tetradactyl state. The modern Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus) has been shown to exhibit fully functional tetradactyly in its forelimb, more so than any other tapir, and represents an ideal case-study for muscular arrangement and architectural comparison with the highly derived monodactyl Equus. Here, we present the first quantification of muscular architecture of a tetradactyl perissodactyl (T. indicus), and compare it to measurements from modern monodactyl caballine horse (Equus ferus caballus). Each muscle of the tapir forelimb was dissected out from a cadaver and measured for architectural properties: muscle-tendon unit (MTU) length, MTU mass, muscle mass, pennation angle, and resting fibre length. Comparative parameters [physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), muscle volume, and % muscle mass] were then calculated from the raw measurements. In the shoulder region, the infraspinatus of T. indicus exhibits dual origination sites on either side of the deflected scapular spine. Within ungulates, this condition has only been previously reported in suids. Differences in relative contribution to limb muscle mass between T. indicus and Equus highlight forelimb muscles that affect mobility in the lateral and medial digits (e.g. extensor digitorum lateralis). These muscles were likely reduced in equids during their evolutionary transition from tetradactyl forest-dwellers to monodactyl, open-habitat specialists. Patterns of PCSA across the forelimb were similar between T. indicus and Equus, with the notable exceptions of the biceps brachii and flexor carpi ulnaris, which were much larger in Equus. The differences observed in PCSA between the tapir and horse forelimb muscles highlight muscles that are essential for maintaining stability in the monodactyl limb while moving at high speeds. This quantitative dataset of muscle architecture in a functionally tetradactyl perissodactyl is a pivotal first step towards reconstructing the locomotor capabilities of extinct, four-toed ancestors of modern perissodactyls, and providing further insights into the equid locomotor transition."

We asked whether age affects gait balance recovery adaptation, its retention over months and the transfer of adaptation to an untrained reactive balance task. Healthy adults (26 young, 27 middle-aged and 25 older; average ages 24, 52 and 72 years respectively) completed two tasks. The primary task involved treadmill walking: either unperturbed (control; <i>n</i>=39) or subject to unexpected trip perturbations (training; <i>n</i>=39). A single trip perturbation was repeated after a 14-week retention period. The secondary transfer task, before and after treadmill walking, involved sudden loss of balance in a lean-and-release protocol. For both tasks the anteroposterior margin of stability (MoS) was calculated at foot touchdown. For the first (i.e. novel) trip, older adults required one more recovery step (<i>P</i>=0.03) to regain positive MoS compared to younger, but not middle-aged, adults. However, over several trip perturbations, all age groups increased their MoS for the first recovery step to a similar extent (up to 70%), and retained improvements over 14 weeks, though a decay over time was found for older adults (<i>P</i>=0.002; middle-aged showing a tendency for decay: <i>P</i>=0.076). Thus, although adaptability in reactive gait stability control remains effective across the adult lifespan, retention of adaptations over time appears diminished with aging. Despite these robust adaptations, the perturbation training group did not show superior improvements in the transfer task compared to aged-matched controls (no differences in MoS changes), suggesting that generalizability of acquired fall-resisting skills from gait-perturbation training may be limited."

The purpose of this study was to estimate ankle impedance during the stance phase of running, and compare to previously reported estimates during walking."

This study used transmission-mode ultrasound to investigate the influence of habitual running foot-strike pattern on Achilles tendon properties during barefoot walking and running. Fifteen runners with rearfoot (RFS) and 10 with a forefoot (FFS) foot-strike running pattern had ultrasound transmission velocity measured in the right Achilles tendon during barefoot walking (≈1.1 ms<sup>-1</sup>) and running (≈2.0 ms<sup>-1</sup>). Temporospatial gait parameters, ankle kinematics and vertical ground reaction force were simultaneously recorded. Statistical comparisons between foot-strike patterns were made using repeated measure ANOVAs. FFS was characterised by a significantly shorter stance duration (-4%), greater ankle dorsiflexion (+2°), and higher peak vertical ground reaction force (+20% bodyweight) than RFS running (P < .05). Both groups adopted a RFS pattern during walking, with only the relative timing of peak dorsiflexion (3%), ground reaction force (1-2%) and peak vertical force loading rates (22-23%) differing between groups (P < .05). Peak ultrasound transmission velocity in the Achilles tendon was significantly higher in FFS during walking (≈100 ms<sup>-1</sup>) and running (≈130 ms<sup>-1</sup>) than RFS (P < .05). Functional Achilles tendon properties differ with habitual footfall patterns in recreational runners."

We aimed to (i) simultaneously disrupt metabolic cost and an alternate acute task requirement, namely speed error regulation, and (ii) assess whether the PWS could be explained on the basis of either optimality criterion in this new performance and energetic landscape. Healthy adults (<i>N</i> = 21) walked on an instrumented treadmill under normal conditions and, while negotiating a continuous gait perturbation, imposed leg-length asymmetry. Oxygen consumption, motion capture data and ground reaction forces were continuously recorded for each condition at speeds ranging from 0.6 to 1.8 m s<sup>-1</sup>, including the PWS. Both metabolic and speed regulation measures were disrupted by the perturbation (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Perturbed PWS selection did not exhibit energetic prioritization (although we find some indication of energy minimization after motor adaptation). Similarly, PWS selection did not support prioritization of speed error regulation, which was found to be independent of speed in both conditions. It appears that, during acute exposure to a mechanical gait perturbation of imposed leg-length asymmetry, humans minimize neither energetic cost nor speed regulation errors. Despite the abundance of evidence pointing to energy minimization during normal, steady-state gait, this may not extend acutely to perturbed gait. Understanding how the nervous system acutely controls gait perturbations requires further research that embraces multi-objective control paradigms."

Trunk linear variability and gait spatiotemporal parameters were evaluated. Nonlinear variability (local dynamic stability-LDS), was estimated by the maximum Lyapunov exponent (λ) computed from a trunk marker velocity. The gait descriptors were compared among three distinct groups (N participants): unilateral transtibial amputees (TTA, N = 12); unilateral transfemoral amputees (TFA, N = 13); control group (CT, N = 15). For step width and support phase, the effect of inclination was greater for TFA group, especially in the DOWN condition. Linear variability was higher for amputees (TFA and TTA) especially in the UP condition in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions. TTA and TFA groups presented greater λ values than CT group in medial-lateral direction indicating decreased LDS, but TFA group presented smaller λ values than TTA and CT groups in the V direction. Our findings showed that inclination introduced significant changes in the estimated parameters for all groups, with greater changes for amputee groups. Furthermore, the level of amputation directly affects the analyzed gait parameters being the TFA group the one which presents greater changes.

Proper ankle alignment is important as malalignment can lead to complications that may require revision surgery. This study aimed to determine how anteroposterior (AP) translational malalignment of ankle arthrodesis affects distal foot joint kinematics and plantar pressure. Ankle arthrodesis was performed on ten cadaveric foot specimens using a custom fixture that could fuse the ankle neutrally and induce discrete malalignments (3, 6, and 9 mm) anteriorly and posteriorly. Gait was simulated under each alignment with a robotic gait simulator, and foot bone motion and plantar pressure were quantified. AP translational malalignment did not substantially affect plantar pressure or joint range of motion, but there were several significant differences in joint position throughout stance phase. Differences were seen in five joints (talocalcaneal, talonavicular, calcaneocuboid, fifth tarsometatarsal, and first metatarsophalangeal) and in the position of the first metatarsal relative to the talus. The most extreme effects occurred when the talus was displaced 6 mm or more posteriorly. In vivo, this may lead to aberrant joint loading, which could negatively impact patient outcomes.

An incomplete understanding of the developmental stages of articular cartilage has contributed to limited success in this endeavor. Using next generation RNA sequencing we have transcriptionally characterized two critical stages of AC development in humans - i.e., immature neonatal and mature adult, as well as tissue-engineered cartilage derived from culture expanded human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). We identified key transcription factors (TFs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as candidate drivers of the distinct phenotypes of these tissues. AGTR2, SCGB3A1, TFCP2L1, RORC, and TBX4 stand out as key transcription factors whose expression may be capable of reprogramming engineered cartilage into a more expandable and neonatal-like cartilage primed for maturation into biomechanically competent cartilage. We also identified that the transcriptional profiles of many annotated but poorly studied lncRNAs were dramatically different between these cartilages, indicating that lncRNAs may be also playing significant roles in cartilage biology. Key neonatal-specific lncRNAs identified include AC092818.1, AC099560.1, and KC877982. Collectively, our results suggest that tissue-engineered cartilage can be optimized for future clinical applications by the specific expression of TFs and lncRNAs."

One key metric that can be derived from IMUs are relative angles of body segments which are important for monitoring form in many sports. The purpose of this study was to a) examine the validity of relative angles derived from IMUs placed on the torso and pelvis; and b) determine optimal positioning for torso mounted sensors such that the IMU relative angles match closely with gold standard torso-pelvis and thorax-pelvis relative angle data derived from an optoelectronic camera system. Seventeen adult participants undertook a variety of motion tasks. Four IMUs were positioned on the torso and one was positioned on the pelvis between the posterior superior iliac spines. Reflective markers were positioned around each IMU and over torso and pelvis landmarks. Results showed that the IMUs are valid with the root mean square errors expressed as a percentage of the angle range (RMSE%) ranging between 1% and 7%. Comparison between the IMU relative angles and the torso-pelvis and thorax-pelvis relative angles showed there were moderate to large differences with RMSE% values ranging between 4% and 57%. IMUs are highly accurate at measuring orientation data; however, further work is needed to optimize positioning and modelling approaches so IMU relative angles align more closely with relative angles derived using traditional motion capture methods."

The method uses Bayesian convolutional neural networks with the U-Net architecture, using Monte Carlo dropout that infers an uncertainty metric in addition to the segmentation label. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method using two data sets: 20 fully annotated CTs of the hip and thigh regions and 18 partially annotated CTs that are publicly available from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) database. The experiments showed a Dice coefficient (DC) of 0.891±0.016 (mean±std) and an average symmetric surface distance (ASD) of 0.994±0.230 mm over 19 muscles in the set of 20 CTs. These results were statistically significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art hierarchical multi-atlas method which resulted in 0.845±0.031 DC and 1.556±0.444 mm ASD. We evaluated validity of the uncertainty metric in the multi-class organ segmentation problem and demonstrated a correlation between the pixels with high uncertainty and the segmentation failure. One application of the uncertainty metric in activelearning is demonstrated, and the proposed query pixel selection method considerably reduced the manual annotation cost for expanding the training data set. The proposed method allows an accurate patient-specific analysis of individual muscle shapes in a clinical routine. This would open up various applications including personalization of biomechanical simulation and quantitative evaluation of muscle atrophy."

Herein, we report a sensitive, 3D squeezable graphene-polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) foam-based piezoresistive sensor realized by infusing multilayered graphene nanoparticles into a sugar-scaffolded porous PDMS foam structure. Static and dynamic compressive strain testing of the resulting piezoresistive foam sensors revealed two linear response regions with an average gauge factor of 2.87-8.77 over a strain range of 0-50%. Furthermore, the dynamic stimulus-response revealed the ability of the sensors to effectively track dynamic pressure up to a frequency of 70 Hz. In addition, the sensors displayed a high stability over 36000 cycles of cyclic compressive loading and 100 cycles of complete human gait motion. The 3D sensing foams were applied to experimentally demonstrate accurate human gait monitoring through both simulated gait models and real-time gait characterization experiments. The real-time gait experiments conducted demonstrate that the information of the pressure profile obtained at three locations in the shoe sole could not only differentiate between different kinds of human gaits including walking and running but also identify possible fall conditions. This work also demonstrates the capability of the sensors to differentiate between foot anatomies, such as a flat foot (low central arch) and a medium arch foot, which is biomechanically more efficient. Furthermore, the sensors were able to sense various basic joint movement responses demonstrating their suitability for personalized health-care applications."

As a consequence, the quantity has been given a variety of names, the most closely related being 'rate of force development'. The lack of a proper name has made it difficult to understand how different structures and processes within the sensorimotor system respond to and shape the dynamics of force generation, which is critical for survival in many species. We advocate that ∂[Formula: see text]/∂<i>t</i> be termed 'yank', a term that has previously been informally used and never formally defined. Our aim in this Commentary is to establish the significance of yank in how biological motor systems are organized, evolve and adapt. Further, by defining the quantity in mathematical terms, several measurement variables that are commonly reported can be clarified and unified. In this Commentary, we first detail the many types of motor function that are affected by the magnitude of yank generation, especially those related to time-constrained activities. These activities include escape, prey capture and postural responses to perturbations. Next, we describe the multi-scale structures and processes of the musculoskeletal system that influence yank and can be modified to increase yank generation. Lastly, we highlight recent studies showing that yank is represented in the sensory feedback system, and discuss how this information is used to enhance postural stability and facilitate recovery from postural perturbations. Overall, we promote an increased consideration of yank in studying biological motor and sensory systems."

The blast pressure wave is thought to have a significant contribution to blast related TBI. Due to the limitations and difficulties of conducting blast tests on surrogates, computational modelling has been used as a key method for exploring this field. However, the blast wave modelling methods reported in current literature have drawbacks. They either cannot generate the desirable blast pressure wave history, or they are unable to accurately simulate the blast wave/structure interaction. In addition, boundary conditions, which can have significant effects on model predictions, have not been described adequately. Here, we critically assess the commonly used methods for simulating blast wave propagation in air (open-field blast) and its interaction with the human body. We investigate the predicted blast wave time history, blast wave transmission and the effects of various boundary conditions in 3 dimensional (3D) models of blast prediction. We propose a suitable meshing topology, which enables accurate prediction of blast wave propagation and interaction with the human head and significantly decreases the computational cost in 3D simulations. Finally, we predict strain and strain rate in the human brain during blast wave exposure and show the influence of the blast wave modelling methods on the brain response. The findings presented here can serve as guidelines for accurately modelling blast wave generation and interaction with the human body for injury biomechanics studies and design of prevention systems."

We proposed to build a statistical shape model (SSM) of the scapula and use it to build a framework to predict a complete scapular shape from virtually created scapular bone defects. The bone defects were synthetically created to imitate bone loss in the glenoid region and missing bony part in inferior and superior scapular regions. Sixty seven dry scapulae were used to build the SSM while ten external scapular shapes (not used in SSM building) were selected to map scapular shape variability using its anatomical classification. For each external scapula, four virtual bone defects were created in the superior, inferior and glenoid regions by manually removing a part of the original mesh. Using these defective shapes as prior knowledge, original shapes were reconstructed using scapula SSM and Gaussian process regression. Robustness of the scapula SSM was excellent (generality = 0.79 mm, specificity = 1.74 mm, first 15 principal modes of variations accounted for 95% variability). The validity and quality of the reconstruction of complete scapular bone were evaluated using two methods (1) mesh distances in terms of mean and RMS values and (2) four anatomical measures (three angles: glenoid version, glenoid inclination, and critical shoulder angle, and glenoid center location). The prediction error in the angle measures ranged from 1.0° to 2.2°. For mesh distances, highest mean and RMS error was 0.97 mm and 1.30 respectively. DICE similarity coefficient between the original and predicted shapes was excellent (≥ 0.81). This framework provided high reconstruction accuracy and can be effectively embedded in the pre-surgical planning of shoulder arthroplasty or in morphology-based shoulder biomechanics modeling pipelines."

The goal of this study was to develop an accurate representative helmet model that could be used in further study of head injury to mitigate the toll of concussions in contact sports. An FE model of a Schutt Air XP Pro football helmet was developed through three major steps: geometry development, material characterization, and model validation. The fully assembled helmet model was fit onto a Hybrid III dummy head-neck model and National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) head model and validated through a series of 67 representative impacts similar to those experienced by a football player. The kinematic and kinetic response of the model was compared to the response of the physical experiments, which included force, head linear acceleration, head angular velocity, and carriage acceleration. The outputs between the model and the physical tests were quantitatively evaluated using CORelation and Analysis (CORA), amounting to an overall averaged score of 0.76. The model described in this study has been extensively validated and can function as a building block for innovation in player safety."

Current animal models of PSD and PSA using the middle cerebral artery occlusion model may be associated with motor deficits that can interfere with behavioral tests of depression- and anxiety-like behavior. Unilateral lesions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) have been reported to induce a depression- and anxiety-like phenotype in mice. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of unilateral microinjections of the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the mPFC alone or in combination with the nucleus accumbens (NAc) on the behavior of rats after 2 and 6 weeks. Specifically, we measured anxiety- and depressive-like behavior, locomotion, and cognition. ET-1 injections in the mPFC and NAc resulted in replicable and localized lesions. Lesions to the mPFC and NAc resulted in more time spent in the open arms of the Elevated Plus Maze compared to sham-operated animals at 2 weeks post stroke, indicating decreased anxiety. This effect did not persist until 6 weeks post injection. No differences in locomotion, cognition and depressive-like behavior were found at either time point. In summary, unilateral lesions of mPFC and NAc did not produce a reliable and persistent anxiety and depression phenotype in rats."

Data suggests that H<sub>3</sub>R antagonists exert neuroprotective, cognitive enhancement and antidepressant effects in rodents. The LINS01 compounds were reported as selective H<sub>3</sub>R antagonists, but their effects on memory, anxiety-like behaviour and spontaneous locomotor activity were not evaluated to date. Therefore, this study employed the plus-maze discriminative avoidance task (PM-DAT) to assess concomitantly the effects of LINS01 compounds on short- and long-term memory, anxiety-like behaviour and spontaneous locomotor activity. Thirty-eight adult male Wistar rats were divided into five groups (n = 7-8 per group) according to the treatment. The animals were treated with donepezil (1 mg/kg) and clobenpropit (3 mg/kg) (reference compounds), and with two LINS01 compounds at doses of 5 mg/kg (LINS01003 and LINS01004), and then submitted to the PM-DAT protocol. Saline (vehicle) was used as control group. The behavioural data showed that anxiety-like behaviour, spontaneous locomotor activity and memory effects (short- and long-term) were not affected by the treatment with LINS01004 or clobenpropit. Conversely, treatment with LINS01003 and donepezil impaired the maintenance of discriminative avoidance long-term memory, a hippocampal-dependent memory. Donepezil-treated rats also showed decreased spontaneous locomotor activity and anxiolytic-like effects. In summary, considering that hippocampal damage and memory impairment are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), this work brought important findings regarding the contribution of the histamine system to the effects of LINS01 compounds on memory, anxiety and motility, and suggests that H<sub>3</sub>R antagonism had no effects on anxiety-like behaviour and do not impair discriminative avoidance memory. Furthermore, the findings herein raise new questions about donepezil's function in an ""impaired"" system such as AD, since it prevented the long-term memory formation in healthy rats."

In addition, a significant portion of individuals with Cr transporter (Crt) deficiency (CTD), the leading cause of cerebral Cr deficiency syndromes (CCDS), are diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Part of this is due to the heterogenous nature of the brain and the unique metabolic demands of specific neuronal systems. Of particular interest related to Cr physiology are dopaminergic neurons, as many CCDS patients have ADHD and Cr has been implicated in dopamine-associated neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases.

Three months after the administration of STZ-ICV, rats developed increased locomotor activity, decreased level of anxiety, impaired spatial and working memory. Histological data from the STZ-ICV group demonstrated decreased number of neurons in the CA1 and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus. The STZ-ICV group was characterized with a decrease of total protein content in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex as well as increased levels of the carbonylated proteins in the hippocampus. KTP treatment of STZ-ICV rats normalized anxiety level and regained object recognition memory. KTP abolished the protein loss in prefrontal cortex and decrease the neuronal loss in the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus. STZ-ICV rats, treated with KTP, did not show significant changes in the levels of the carbonylated proteins in specific brain structures or in motor activity and spatial memory compared to the saline-treated STZ-ICV group. Our data show a moderate and selective protective effect of a subchronic ICV administration of the dipeptide KTP on the pathological changes induced by an experimental model of sAD in rats."

We previously reported that Thioredoxin-80 (Trx80), a truncated form of Thioredoxin-1, prevents the toxic effects of Aβ and inhibits its aggregation in vitro. Trx80 levels were found to be dramatically reduced both in the human brain and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients. In this study, we investigated the effect of Trx80 expression using in vivo and in vitro models of Aβ pathology. We developed Drosophila melanogaster models overexpressing either human Trx80, human Aβ<sub>42</sub>, or both Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Trx80 in the central nervous system. We found that Trx80 expression prevents Aβ<sub>42</sub> accumulation in the brain and rescues the reduction in life span and locomotor impairments seen in Aβ<sub>42</sub> expressing flies. Also, we show that Trx80 induces autophagosome formation and reverses the inhibition of Atg4b-Atg8a/b autophagosome formation pathway caused by Aβ<sub>42</sub>. These effects were also confirmed in human neuroblastoma cells. These results give insight into Trx80 function in vivo, suggesting its role in the autophagosome biogenesis and thus in Aβ<sub>42</sub> degradation. Our findings put Trx80 on the spotlight as an endogenous agent against Aβ<sub>42</sub>-induced toxicity in the brain suggesting that strategies to enhance Trx80 levels in neurons could potentially be beneficial against AD pathology in humans."

Our previous study developed a series of opioid and neuropeptide FF (NPFF) pharmacophore-containing chimeric peptides, including DN-9 (Tyr-D.Ala-Gly-NMe.Phe-Gly-Pro-Gln-Arg-Phe-NH<sub>2</sub>), which produced potent nontolerance forming analgesia at the supraspinal level. In the present study, the antinociceptive effects of DN-9 in a series of preclinical pain models and the potential side-effects were investigated at the spinal level in mice. In the tail-flick test, intrathecal injection of DN-9 produced potent analgesia with an ED<sub>50</sub> value at 1.33 pmol, and the spinal antinociception of DN-9 was mainly mediated by μ- and κ-opioid receptors. In addition, DN-9-induced spinal antinociception was augmented by the NPFF receptors antagonist. Furthermore, DN-9 could decrease both the frequency and amplitude of sEPSCs in lamina IIo neurons of the spinal cord, which were mediated by opioid receptors. In contrast to morphine, chronic intrathecal treatments with DN-9 did not induce analgesic tolerance, c-Fos expression or microglial activation. Intrathecal injection of DN-9 showed potent analgesia with antinociceptive ED<sub>50</sub> values between 0.66 and 55.04 pmol in different pain models, including the formalin test, acetic acid-induced writhing test, carrageen-induced inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain. Moreover, DN-9 did not show side effects in locomotor function and coordination, gastrointestinal transit inhibition, the cardiovascular system, and body temperature regulation at antinociceptive doses. Taken together, the present study showed DN-9 produced effective, nontolerance forming analgesia with reduced side effects at the spinal level. DN-9 might be a promising compound for developing multifunctional opioid analgesics with limited adverse effects. Perspective: This article presents the potent and nontolerance forming analgesia effects of DN-9 in a series of preclinical pain models with less opioid related adverse effects at the spinal level in mice. This study also demonstrates that DN-9 has translational potential into an intrathecal analgesic."

Currently, it is unclear whether interneurons responsible for timing control are distinct from those involved in amplitude control. Here, we show that in larval zebrafish, molecularly, morphologically and electrophysiologically distinct types of V2a neurons exhibit complementary patterns of connectivity. Stronger higher-order connections from type I neurons to other excitatory V2a and inhibitory V0d interneurons provide timing control, while stronger last-order connections from type II neurons to motor neurons provide amplitude control. Thus, timing and amplitude are coordinated by distinct interneurons distinguished not by their occupation of hierarchically-arranged anatomical layers, but rather by differences in the reliability and probability of higher-order and last-order connections that ultimately form a single anatomical layer. These findings contribute to our understanding of the origins of timing and amplitude control in the spinal cord."

In the present study, we investigated in how far cognitive and motor functioning interfere in an outdoor environment. Our participants performed an auditory oddball task while concurrently completing various motor tasks on the outside premises of our institute. Beside behavioural responses and subjective workload ratings, we also analysed electrophysiological data recorded with a 30-channel mobile EEG montage. We observed an increase of subjective workload and decrease of performance with increasing movement complexity. Accordingly, we also found a decrease in the parietal P3 amplitude as well as in frontal midline Theta power with higher motor load. These results indicate that an increased movement complexity imposes a higher workload to the cognitive system, which, in turn, effectively reduces the availability of cognitive resources for the cognitive task. Overall this experiment demonstrates the feasibility of transferring classical paradigms of cognitive research to real-world settings. The findings support the notion of shared resources for motor and cognitive functions by demonstrating distinct modulations of correlates of cognitive processes across different motor tasks."

Here, we aim at covering all main aspects of this complex behavior - from the operation of the microcircuits in the spinal cord to the systems and behavioral levels and extend from mammalian locomotion to the basic undulatory movements of lamprey and fish. The cellular basis of propulsion represents the core of the control system and it involves the spinal central pattern generator networks (CPGs) controlling the timing of different muscles, the sensory compensation for perturbations and the brainstem command systems controlling the level of activity of the CPGs and the speed of locomotion. The forebrain and in particular the basal ganglia are involved in determining which motor programs should be recruited at a given point of time and can both initiate and stop locomotor activity. The propulsive control system needs to be integrated with the postural control system to maintain body orientation. Moreover, the locomotor movements need to be steered so that the subject approaches the goal of the locomotor episode, or avoids colliding with elements in the environment or simply escapes at high speed. These different aspects will all be covered in the review."

The neuroprotective effects of melatonin in SCI models have been reported; however, it is unclear whether the beneficial effects of melatonin are associated with alleviation of gut dysbiosis. In this study, we showed that daily intraperitoneal injection with melatonin following spinal cord contusion at thoracic level 10 in mice improved intestinal barrier integrity and GI motility, reduced expression levels of certain proinflammatory cytokines, improved animal weight gain and metabolic profiling, and promoted locomotor recovery. Analysis of gut microbiome revealed that melatonin treatment decreased the Shannon index and reshaped the composition of intestinal microbiota. Melatonin-treated SCI animals showed decreased relative abundance of <i>Clostridiales</i> and increased relative abundance of <i>Lactobacillales</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, which correlated with alteration of cytokine (monocyte chemotactic protein 1) expression and GI barrier permeability, as well as with locomotor recovery. Experimental induction of gut dysbiosis in mice before SCI (i.e., by oral delivery of broad-spectrum antibiotics) exacerbates neurological impairment after SCI, and melatonin treatment improves locomotor performance and intestinal integrity in antibiotic-treated SCI mice. The results suggest that melatonin treatment restores SCI-induced alteration in gut microbiota composition, which may underlie the ameliorated GI function and behavioral manifestations."

This study aimed to determine the intramuscular nerve distribution of the oculomotor nerve within the inferior oblique muscle (IO) using Sihler's staining. <b>Method</b>: Seventy-two IOs from 50 formalin-embalmed cadavers were investigated. The IO including its branch of the oculomotor nerve was finely dissected from its origin to its insertion point into the sclera. The total length of the muscle and its width were measured. The intramuscular nerve course was investigated after performing Sihler's staining, which is a whole-mount nerve-staining technique that stains the nerves while rendering other soft tissues either translucent or transparent. <b>Results</b>: The total length of the muscle and muscle width were 30.0±2.8 mm (mean±standard deviation), 8.8±1.2 mm, respectively. The oculomotor nerve enters the IO around the middle of the muscle and then divides into multiple smaller branches without distinct subdivisions. The intramuscular nerve distribution within the IO has a root-like arborization and supplies the entire width of the muscle. The Sihler's stained intramuscular nerve course (covering a length of 7.6±1.2 mm) finishes around the distal one-third of the IO in gross observations. <b>Conclusion</b>: Sihler's staining is a useful technique for visualizing the gross nerve distribution of the IO. This new information about the nerve distribution and morphological features will improve the understanding of the biomechanics of the IO."

By introducing archaerhodopsin into engrailed-1-positive neurons, we demonstrate that the function of V1 neurons in locomotor-like activity is more complex than previously thought. In the whole cord, V1 hyperpolarization increased the rhythmic synaptic drive to flexor and extensor motoneurons, increased the spiking in each cycle, and slowed the locomotor-like rhythm. In the hemicord, V1 hyperpolarization accelerated the rhythm after an initial period of tonic activity, implying that a subset of V1 neurons are active in the hemicord, which was confirmed by calcium imaging. Hyperpolarizing V1 neurons resulted in an equalization of the duty cycle in flexor and extensors from an asymmetrical pattern in control recordings in which the extensor bursts were longer than the flexor bursts. Our results suggest that V1 interneurons are composed of several subsets with different functional roles. Furthermore, during V1 hyperpolarization, the default state of the locomotor central pattern generator (CPG) is symmetrical, with antagonist motoneurons each firing with an approximately 50% duty cycle. We hypothesize that one function of the V1 population is to set the burst durations of muscles to be appropriate to their biomechanical function and to adapt to the environmental demands, such as changes in locomotor speed."

RIS photoactivation allows the animal to maintain its body posture by sustaining muscle tone, yet inactivating motor neuron oscillatory activity.

When listening to music, we spontaneously perceive and predict its beat. The process of beat perception comprises both beat inference and beat maintenance, their relative importance depending on the salience of beat in the music. To study functional connectivity associated with these processes in a naturalistic situation, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain responses of participants while they were listening to a piece of music containing strong contrasts in beat salience. Subsequently, we utilized dynamic graph analysis and psychophysiological interactions (PPI) analysis in connection with computational modelling of beat salience to investigate how functional connectivity manifests these processes. As the main effect, correlation analyses between the obtained dynamic graph measures and the beat salience measure revealed increased centrality in auditory-motor cortices, cerebellum, and extrastriate visual areas during low beat salience, whereas regions of the default mode- and central executive networks displayed high centrality during high beat salience. PPI analyses revealed partial dissociation of functional networks belonging to this pathway indicating complementary neural mechanisms crucial in beat inference and maintenance, processes pivotal for extracting and predicting temporal regularities in our environment."

Treatment with the FDA-approved β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) agonist formoterol has been shown to induce mitochondrial biogenesis (MB) in both the spinal cord and skeletal muscle and, therefore, has the potential to address comprehensive mitochondrial and organ dysfunction following SCI. Female C57BL/6 mice were subjected to moderate contusion SCI (80 Kdyn) followed by daily administration of vehicle or formoterol beginning 8 h after injury, a clinically relevant time-point characterized by a 50% decrease in mtDNA content in the injury site. As measured by the Basso Mouse Scale, formoterol treatment improved locomotor recovery in SCI mice compared to vehicle treatment by 7 DPI, with continued recovery observed through 21 DPI (3.5 v. 2). SCI resulted in 15% body weight loss in all mice by 3 DPI. Mice treated with formoterol returned to pre-surgery weight by 13 DPI, while no weight gain occurred in vehicle-treated SCI mice. Remarkably, formoterol-treated mice exhibited a 30% increase in skeletal muscle mass compared to those treated with vehicle 21 DPI (0.93 v. 0.72% BW), corresponding with increased MB and decreased skeletal muscle atrophy. These effects were not observed in ADRB2 knockout mice subjected to SCI, indicating that formoterol is acting via the ADRB2 receptor. Furthermore, knockout mice exhibited decreased basal spinal cord and skeletal muscle PGC-1α expression, suggesting that ADRB2 may play a role in mitochondrial homeostasis under physiological conditions. These data provide evidence for systemic ADRB2-mediated MB as a therapeutic avenue for the treatment of SCI."

However, brain mechanisms associated with hunger and neural circuitries that mediate hunger driven responses remained to be investigated. To understand neural signaling of hunger, local field potentials (LFPs) in the lateral hypothalamus (LHa), nucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsal hippocampus (HP) and olfactory bulb (OB) and their interconnectivities were studied in freely moving adult male Albino mice during 18-20 h food deprivation and fed periods. Raw LFP signals were recorded and analyzed for mean values of spectral frequency power and coherence values. One-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant increases in spectral powers of beta and gamma frequency ranges induced by food deprivation in the LHa, HP, NAc but not OB. No change of spectral power in these brain regions was induced by food feeding. The analyses of coherent activity between brain regions also deliniated some distributed neural network activities correlated with hunger. In particular, coherent function indicated the increased beta and gamma phase synchrony between the pairs of LHa-HP and NAc-OB regions, and decreased gamma synchrony between the pairs of LHa-NAc and NAc-HP induced by food deprivation. It was found that plasma glucose level, locomotor count, travelled distance and time spent on moving were not altered by food deprivation. These results suggest that changes in LFP hallmarks in these brain regions were associated with hunger driven by negative energy balance."

The NPS system controls several biological functions, including anxiety, wakefulness, locomotor activity, food intake, and pain transmission. A growing body of evidence supports facilitatory effects for NPS over dopaminergic neurotransmission. The present study was aimed to investigate the role of dopamine receptors signaling in the antinociceptive effects of NPS in the mouse formalin test. The following dopamine receptor antagonists were employed: SCH 23390 (selective dopamine D<sub>1</sub> antagonist, 0.05 mg/kg, ip), haloperidol (non-selective dopamine D<sub>2</sub>-like receptor antagonist; 0.03 mg/kg, ip), and sulpiride (selective dopamine D<sub>2</sub>-like receptor antagonist; 25 mg/kg, ip). Mice were pretreated with dopamine antagonists before the supraspinal administration of NPS (0.1 nmol, icv). Morphine (5 mg/kg, sc) and indomethacin (10 mg/kg, ip) were used as positive controls to set up the experimental conditions. Morphine-induced antinociceptive effects were observed during phases 1 and 2 of the test, while indomethacin was only active at phase 2. Central NPS significantly reduced formalin-induced nociception during both phases. The systemic administration of SCH 23390 slightly blocked the effects of NPS only during phase 2. Haloperidol prevented NPS-induced antinociceptive effects. Similar to haloperidol, sulpiride also counteracted the antinociceptive effects of NPS in both phases of the formalin test. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that the analgesic effects of NPS are linked with dopaminergic neurotransmission mainly through dopamine D<sub>2</sub>-like receptor signaling."

However, without systemic immunosuppressive therapy, most of these grafted cells are rejected by the hosts. Long term and systemic injection of cyclosporine-A (CsA) is required to maintain the survival of grafted cells. The purpose this study is to examine a new treatment strategy to suppress the immunorejection by locally co-grafting of polylactic/glycolic acid nanoparticles containing CsA (NanoCsA) with differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In the in vitro media, NanoCsA provided sustained release of CsA for >6 weeks. The differentiated human iPSCs were co-grafted with NanoCsA or NanoVeh (nanoparticle without CsA) to the striatum of unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine -lesioned rats. NanoCsA/iPSCs co-graft significantly improved locomotor activity compared to NanoVeh/iPSCs co-grafts or iPSC grafts + sytemic CsA at 1 month after transplantation. Brain tissues were collected for measurements of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and human marker Stem121 immunoreactivity. Cografting with NanoCsA/iPSCs, compared to NanoVeh/iPSCs, significantly increased TH and Stem121 immunoreactivity as well as tumor formation in the lesioned striatum. Taken together, our study supports that NanoCsA provides long-lasting CsA release and reduces immunorejection of human iPSCs xenograft in a 6-hydroxydopamine rat model of PD."

Using the Drosophila motor system, we manipulate expression of the classic temporal transcription factor, Hunchback (Hb) specifically in the NB7-1 stem cell, which produces U motor neurons (MNs), and then we monitor dendrite morphology and neuromuscular synaptic partnerships. We find that prolonged expression of Hb leads to transient specification of U MN identity, and that embryonic molecular markers do not accurately predict U MN terminal features. Nonetheless, our data show Hb acts as a potent regulator of neuromuscular wiring decisions. These data introduce important refinements to current models, show that molecular information acting early in neurogenesis as a switch to control motor circuit wiring and provide novel insight into the relationship between stem cell and circuit."

Since depression is a common co-morbid condition with PD, we undertook this study to determine whether Hc-TeTx might also show antidepressant-like properties and whether central brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha are also affected by it. Adult male Wistar-Kyoto rats, a putative animal model of depression, were treated with various doses of Hc-TeTx (0, 20, 40 and 60 μg/kg, IM) and their performance in the open field locomotor activity (OFLA) as well as in the forced swim test (FST) was evaluated at 24 h, one week and two weeks after the single injection. A separate group of rats were injected with 60 μg/kg Hc-TeTx and sacrificed 24 h later for neurochemical evaluations. Hc-TeTx resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in immobility score after 24 h, whereas OFLA was not affected. Concomitant with the 24 h behavioral effects, the levels of hippocampal and frontal cortical BDNF were significantly increased, whereas the levels of TNF-alpha in both these areas were significantly decreased. The decrease in immobility scores following higher doses of Hc-TeTx were still evident after one week, but not 2 weeks of rest. These results indicate long lasting antidepressant effects of a single Hc-TeTx dose and suggest potential utility of Hc-TeTx in PD-depression co-morbidity."

Here, we studied the molecular mechanisms causing giant axonal neuropathy (GAN), a severe neurodegenerative disease due to loss-of-function of the gigaxonin-E3 ligase. We showed that gigaxonin governs Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) induction, the developmental pathway patterning the dorso-ventral axis of the neural tube and muscles, by controlling the degradation of the Shh-bound Patched receptor. Similarly to Shh inhibition, repression of gigaxonin in zebrafish impaired motor neuron specification and somitogenesis and abolished neuromuscular junction formation and locomotion. Shh signaling was impaired in gigaxonin null zebrafish and was corrected by both pharmacological activation of the Shh pathway and human gigaxonin, pointing to an evolutionary-conserved mechanism regulating Shh signaling. Gigaxonin-dependent inhibition of Shh activation was also demonstrated in primary fibroblasts from GAN patients and in a Shh activity reporter line depleted in gigaxonin. Our findings establish gigaxonin as a key E3 ligase that positively controls the initiation of Shh transduction, reveal the causal role of Shh dysfunction in motor deficits, thus highlighting the developmental origin of GAN."

During the light cycle, caffeine exposed mice exhibited hypoactivity in a novel open-field box and increased anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors, while maintaining normal home cage locomotor activity. In contrast, during the dark cycle caffeine exposed mice displayed normal locomotor activity in a novel open-field box with hyperactive home cage activity.

Reward seeking for sucrose was higher in caffeine exposed than control mice during the light cycle. Additionally, when granted 24 -h access to ethanol as adults, caffeine exposed mice consumed more ethanol in the absence of acute caffeine use. Altogether, mice that consumed chronic caffeine beginning in adolescence had increased reward seeking and exhibited a circadian-dependent pattern of mood fluctuations in adulthood."

Various polymorphisms in ADGRL3 have been linked with an increased risk of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study, we examined the characteristics of Adgrl3-deficient mice in multiple behavioural domains related to ADHD: locomotive activity, impulsivity, gait, visuospatial and recognition memory, sociability, anxiety-like behaviour and aggression. Additionally, we investigated the effect of Adgrl3-depletion at the transcriptomic level by RNA-sequencing three ADHD-relevant brain regions: prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus and striatum. Adgrl3<sup>-/-</sup> mice show increased locomotive activity across all tests and subtle gait abnormalities. These mice also show impairments across spatial memory and learning domains, alongside increased levels of impulsivity and sociability with decreased aggression. However, these alterations were absent in Adgrl3<sup>+/</sup><sup>-</sup> mice. Across all brain regions tested, the numbers of genes found to exhibit differential expression was relatively small, indicating a specific pathway of action, rather than a broad neurobiological perturbation. Gene-set analysis of differential expression in the PFC detected a number of ADHD-relevant pathways including dopaminergic synapses as well as cocaine and amphetamine addiction. The Slc6a3 gene coding for the dopamine transporter was the most dysregulated gene in the PFC. Unexpectedly, several neurohormone/peptides which are typically only expressed in the hypothamalus were found to be dysregulated in the striatum. Our study further validates Adgrl3 constitutive knockout mice as an experimental model of ADHD while providing neuroanatomical targets for future studies involving ADGRL3 modified models.

Fenbendazole is widely used in veterinary medicine. However, it is not approved for human use and it was uncertain if only post-injury administration would offer similar benefits. In the present study we evaluated post-injury administration of a closely related, human anthelmintic drug, flubendazole, using a rat spinal cord contusion injury model. Flubendazole, administered i.p. 5 or 10 mg/kg day, beginning 3 h post-injury and daily thereafter for 2 or 4 weeks, resulted in improved locomotor function after contusion spinal cord injury (SCI) compared with vehicle-treated controls. Histological analysis of spinal cord sections showed that such treatment with flubendazole also reduced lesion volume and improved total tissue sparing, white matter sparing, and gray matter sparing. Flubendazole inhibited the activation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP); suppressed cyclin B1 expression and Bruton tyrosine kinase activation, markers of B cell activation/proliferation and inflammation; and reduced B cell autoimmune response. Together, these results suggest the use of the benzimidazole anthelmintic flubendazole as a potential therapeutic for SCI."

OXB-102, a lentiviral vector with an optimized expression cassette for dopamine biosynthesis, has been shown to achieve a significantly higher dopamine yield than ProSavin. We assessed the efficacy of OXB-102 in the MPTP macaque model of Parkinson's disease (PD). At 6 months post-vector administration, all treated animals showed significant improvements in clinical scores and spontaneous locomotor activity compared to controls, with the highest recovery observed in the OXB-102 high-dose (HD) group. Positron emission tomography quantification of 6-[<sup>18</sup>F]-fluoro-L-m-tyrosine uptake showed a significant increase in amino acid decarboxylase activity for all treated animals, compared with controls, where the OXB-102 HD group showed the highest level of dopaminergic activity.

However, it is unknown how action fluency affects the sensitivity of early-stage visual perception, such as orientation. To address this question, we used a dual-task paradigm: Participants prepared an action (e.g., grasping), while concurrently performing an orientation-change-detection task. We demonstrated that as actions became more fluent (e.g., as grasping errors decreased), perceptual-discrimination performance also improved. Importantly, we found that grasping training prior to discrimination enhanced subsequent perceptual sensitivity, supporting the notion of a reciprocal relation between perception and action."

Walking speed is often used as a standardized measure in locomotor assessment of overground walking in human and pre-clinical studies, but the assessment of walking speed is typically ignored during skilled locomotor tasks. Ample empirical evidence indicates that walking speeds on the horizontal ladder are largely non-uniform after central nervous system trauma, suggesting that it could pose a potential source of variability in assessing motor deficits. Here, we investigate whether walking speed influences the assessment of motor recovery during skilled walking after a spinal cord injury (SCI). We hypothesized that if rats walk at imposed walking speeds, motor deficits and recovery after an SCI will be more reliably assessed than when not controlling walking speeds. To address this, we developed a novel speed-controlled <u>A</u>utomated <u>D</u>evice for the <u>A</u>ssessment and <u>T</u>raining of <u>S</u>killed locomotion (ADATS) as a surrogate device to the horizontal ladder. The ADATS allows testing at user-defined speeds, thereby forcing the rats to step consistently. Our results demonstrate that: 1) the ability to walk (or not) at one or multiple speeds on the ADATS serves as a gross measure of motor dysfunction/recovery after a spinal cord injury and 2) skilled motor deficits are more readily detected at lower than higher walking speeds. We conclude that walking speed is an important factor in the analyses of skilled locomotion and testing at multiple speeds is useful in accurately measuring recovery after neurotrauma in rats."

Somatosensory pathways that can be assessed with cutaneous reflex paradigms assist in subserving these connections. Many studies show that stimulation of cutaneous nerves elicits reflexes in muscles widespread across the body and induces neural plasticity after training. Sensory enhancement, such as long duration trains of transcutaneous stimulation, facilitates performance during rehabilitation training or fatiguing motor tasks. Performance improvements due to sensory stimulation may be caused by altered spinal and corticospinal excitability. However, how enhanced sensory input regulates the excitability of interlimb cutaneous reflex pathways has not been studied. Our purpose was to investigate the effects of sensory enhancement on interlimb cutaneous reflexes in wrist extensor muscles. Stimulation to provide sensory enhancement (2 s trains at 15 Hz to median or superficial radial nerves) or evoke cutaneous reflexes (15 ms trains at 300 Hz to superficial radial) was applied in different arms while participants (n=13) performed graded isometric wrist extension. Wrist extensor EMG and cutaneous reflexes were measured bilaterally. We found amplified inhibitory reflexes in the arm receiving superficial radial and median nerve sensory enhancement with net reflex amplitudes decreased by 709.5% and 695.3% repetitively. This suggests sensory input alters neuronal excitabilities in the interlimb cutaneous pathways. These findings have potential application in facilitating motor function recovery through alterations in spinal cord excitability enhancing sensory input during targeted rehabilitation and sports training."

Our research group developed the SLA16 (SHR.LEW-Anxrr16) congenic strain, which is genetically identical to the SHR strain, except for a locus on chromosome 4 (DGR). We applied in silico analysis on DGR to evaluate the association of their genes with neurobiological and metabolic pathways. After, we characterized cholesterol, triglycerides, metabolism of glucose and the behavioral performance of young (2 months old) and adult (8 months old) SHR and SLA16 rats in the open field, object location and water maze tasks. Finally, naïve young rats were repeatedly treated with metformin (200 mg/kg; v.o.) and evaluated in the same tests. Bioinformatics analysis showed that DGR presents genes related to glucose metabolism, oxidative damage and neurodegenerative diseases. Young SLA16 presented higher cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and locomotion in the open field than SHR rats. In adulthood, SLA16 rats presented high triglycerides and locomotion in the open field and impairment on spatial learning and memory. Finally, the treatment with metformin decreased the glucose tolerance curve and also improved long-term memory in SLA16 rats. These results indicate that DGR presents genes associated with metabolic pathways and neurobiological processes that may produce alterations in glucose metabolism and spatial learning/memory. Therefore, we suggest that SHR and SLA16 strains could be important for the study of genes and subsequent mechanisms that produce metabolic glucose alterations and age-related cognitive deficits."

The axial compression experiment and the radial torsion experiment were carried out on each of the mixed rod group and the double rod group. Four models were randomly selected from the two groups for axial compression experiment and radial torsion experiment, respectively. The changes of axial compression yield load and displacement, and also radial torsional yield load and angle were observed in two groups. At the same time, the maximum load was recorded when the curve had a break point or in a horizontal state, and then calculated the yield load. The data of normal distribution were compared with one-sample <i>t</i> test. <b>Results:</b> When the two groups were compressed axially at the same speed, as the axial compression yield load increased gradually, the longitudinal compression displacement of the mixed-rod group was obviously smaller than that in the double-rod group; and the maximum axial compression yield load of the mixed-rod group was greater than that in the double-rod group ((7 517±4)N vs (2 290±4) N, <i>t=</i>1 848.071, <i>P=</i>0.000). When the two groups were twisted radially at the same speed,as radial torsional yield load increased gradually, the radial torsion angle of the mixed-rod group was smaller than that in the double-rod group; and the maximum radial torsional yield load of the mixed-rod group was greater than that in the double-rod group ((61.3±2.0) Nm vs (24.4±2.2)Nm, <i>t=</i>25.201, <i>P=</i>0.000). <b>Conclusions:</b> For the long segment comminuted fracture of femoral shaft, the mixed-rod of BCFS can fix fracture more strongly than double-rod in longitudinal direction and maintain the stability of fracture end.

However, this reduction in knee loading is quantified by net joint moments (NJM). As a result, in the presence of greater hamstring activity, the true contribution from the knee extensors may not be reduced. The purpose of this study is to compare hamstring activity and strength and knee joint moments between individuals post-ACLr and controls. Eighteen individuals 3 months post-ACLr and matched controls walked and net knee extensor moment peak and impulse and hamstring activity were identified during LR, as well as maximal hamstring strength. A hybrid musculoskeletal model estimated knee flexor moments from joint kinematics and hamstring electromyography. Flexor moments (SIMM) were scaled based on strength. Knee extensor moments were estimated from the sum of the net knee moment and estimated knee flexor moment; estimated extensor moment peaks and impulse were calculated during LR. Repeated measures ANOVAs compared groups and limbs. Smaller net knee extensor moment and greater hamstring activity, as well as deficits in maximal hamstring strength, were observed in the surgical limb (all p<0.05). When accounting for the torque-producing capabilities of the knee flexors, estimated knee extensor moment peak and impulse were smaller in the surgical limb. These findings suggest that net knee moments accurately reflect smaller knee extensor loading post-ACLr. Statement of Clinical Significance: Rehabilitation programs should target increasing knee extensor loading to restore gait mechanics during early rehabilitation.

Proper coupling between sympathetic and somatomotor systems allows controlled regulation of cardiovascular responses to exercise. In people with SCI, altered connectivity between descending pathways and spinal segments impairs sympathetic and somatomotor coordination, which may have deleterious effects during exercise and limit rehabilitation outcomes. We postulated that high-intensity LT, which repeatedly engages SS systems, would alter SS coupling. Thirteen individuals (50 ± 7.2 years) with motor incomplete spinal cord injuries (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale C or D; injury level >T6) participated in a locomotor treadmill training program. Patients were randomized into either a high-intensity (high-LT; 70-85% of maximum predicted heart rate; <i>n</i> = 6) group or a low-intensity (low-LT; 50-65% of maximum predicted heart rate; <i>n</i> = 7) group and completed up to 20 LT training sessions over 4-6 weeks, 3-5 days/week. Before and after taining, we tested SS coupling by eliciting reflexive sympathetic activity through a cold stimulation, noxious stimulation, and a mental math task while we measured tendon reflexes, blood pressure, and heart rate. Participants who completed high- versus low-LT exhibited significant decreases in reflex torques during triggered sympathetic activity (cold: -83 vs. 13%, <i>p</i> < 0.01; pain: -65 vs. 54%, <i>p</i> < 0.05; mental math: -43 vs. 41%; <i>p</i> < 0.05). Mean arterial pressure responses to sympathetic stimuli were slightly higher following high- versus low-LT (cold: 30 vs. -1.5%; pain: 6 vs. -12%; mental math: 5 vs. 7%), although differences were not statistically significant. These results suggest that high-LT may be advantageous to low-LT to improve SS coupling in people with incomplete SCI."

Specifically, we focused on measurement of the quality of upper limb movement. We agreed that the recommended protocols for measurement should be conceptually rigorous, reliable, valid and responsive to change. The recommended measurement protocols include four performance assays (i.e. 2D planar reaching, finger individuation, grip strength, and precision grip at body function level) and one functional task (3D drinking task at activity level) that address body function and activity respectively. This document describes the criteria for assessment and makes recommendations about the type of technology that should be used for reliable and valid movement capture. Standardization of kinematic measurement protocols will allow pooling of participant data across sites, thereby increasing sample size aiding meta-analyses of published trials, more detailed exploration of recovery profiles, the generation of new research questions with testable hypotheses, and development of new treatment approaches focused on impairment. We urge the clinical and research community to consider adopting these recommendations."

The degree of neurological recovery greatly influences a patient's treatment and expected quality of life. This has resulted in the development of machine learning algorithms (MLA) that use acute demographic and neurological information to prognosticate recovery. The van Middendorp et al. (2011) (vM) logistic regression (LR) model has been established as a reference model for the prediction of walking recovery following spinal cord injury as it has been validated within many different countries. However, an examination of the way in which these prediction models are evaluated is warranted. The area under the receiver operators curve (AUROC) has been consistently used when evaluating model performance, but it has been shown that AUROC overemphasizes the most common event resulting in an inaccurate assessment when the data is imbalanced. Furthermore, there is evidence that the use of more advanced MLA, such as an unsupervised k-means model, may show superior performance compared to LR as they can handle a larger number of features."

BMD recovery offers an increased quality of life for people with SCI by reducing their risk of fractures. The standing system developed comprises an instrumented frame equipped with force plates and load cells, a motion capture system, and a purpose built 16-channel FES unit. This system can simultaneously record and process a wide range of biomechanical data to produce muscle stimulation which enables users with SCI to safely stand and exercise. An exergame provides visual feedback to the user to assist with upper-body posture control during exercising. To validate the system an alternate weight-shift exercise was used; 3 participants with complete SCI exercised in the system for 1 hour twice-weekly for 6 months. We observed ground reaction forces over 70% of the full body-weight distributed to the supporting leg at each exercising cycle. Exercise performance improved for each participant by an increase of 13.88 percentage points of body-weight in the loading of the supporting leg during the six-month period. Importantly, the observed ground reaction forces are of higher magnitude than other studies which reported positive effects on BMD. This novel instrumentation aims to investigate weight bearing standing therapies aimed at determining the biomechanics of lower limb joint force actions and postural kinematics."

Robotics may offer a promising tool to address this compelling problem, but whether and how invasive species can be negatively affected by robotic stimuli is an open question. Here, we explore the possibility of modulating behavioural and life-history responses of mosquitofish by varying the degree of biomimicry of a robotic predator, whose appearance and locomotion are inspired by natural mosquitofish predators. Our results support the prediction that real-time interactions at varying swimming speeds evoke a more robust antipredator response in mosquitofish than simpler movement patterns by the robot, especially in individuals with better body conditions that are less prone to take risks. Through an information-theoretic analysis of animal-robot interactions, we offer evidence in favour of a causal link between the motion of the robotic predator and a fish antipredator response. Remarkably, we observe that even a brief exposure to the robotic predator of 15 min per week is sufficient to erode energy reserves and compromise the body condition of mosquitofish, opening the door for future endeavours to control mosquitofish in the wild."

Ratings of perceived exertion during walking predicts endurance independent of physiological effort in older women. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-This study aimed to determine whether ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and physiological effort at different exercise intensities relate to exercise endurance. Ninety-eight sedentary women (older than 60 years) completed 3 submaximal locomotion tasks: (a) stair climbing, (b) flat walking at 2 mph, and (c) grade walking at 2 mph. Maximal treadmill endurance was measured at least 3 days before the submaximal tests. Oxygen uptake was measured during all tests, and RPE were collected for the submaximal tasks. Ratings of perceived exertion during moderate-intensity exercise (walking on the flat at 43% V[Combining Dot Above]O2max, partial R = -0.35, p < 0.01), but not higher intensity exercise (grade walk at 59% V[Combining Dot Above]O2max, p = 0.49, and stair climbing at 67% V[Combining Dot Above]O2max, p = 0.17), were related to endurance even after adjusting for aerobic capacity and physiological effort (composite of maximal heart rate, ventilation, and respiratory exchange ratio). However, physiological effort was significantly related to endurance for the higher intensity exercise (both grade walk and stair climbing partial R >-0.24, p < 0.02). Similar to previous findings that subjective ratings of fatigue at rest were related to RPE during low/moderate-intensity exercise, but not higher intensity exercise, these data further support Ekkekakis's dual-mode hypothesis that cognitive factors influence RPE during low/moderate-intensity exercise. A practical application is that the coach and personal trainer should know that physiological effort seems to play a greater role in influencing endurance than RPE as intensity of exercise increases."

However, manual propulsion causes biomechanical loads, including contact pressures on the palms of the hands. The hand rim design has received little attention over time, remaining almost unchanged since its creation. This study investigated how two different designs of such devices - one standard and another with a contoured design - influence the contact pressure on the surface of the hands. The procedures included a figure-of-eight shape propulsion task on a regular floor, using both models on a wheelchair. A pressure-mapping system coupled with a pair of fabric gloves recorded the data. The results show that the contoured hand rim provides lower pressure in most of the analysed regions. Considering that manual propulsion is performed during a considerable part of the day as a routine activity, improving the hand rim interface may benefit the user's comfort and safety during wheelchair use. <b>Practitioner summary:</b> The design of the hand rim used in wheelchair propulsion influences the contact pressure on the hands. Conventional round tube rims tend to concentrate high levels of pressure on the distal phalanges and metacarpal regions. A contoured design generally provides better stability and promotes the distribution of pressure. <b>Abbreviations:</b> AT: assistive technology; kPa: kilopascal."

This approach combines microfracture of the subchondral bone with the implant at the site of the cartilage defect of a supporting biomaterial in the form of microspheres aimed at creating an adequate biomechanical environment for the differentiation of the mesenchymal stem cells that migrate from the bone marrow. The possible inflammatory response to these biomaterials was previously studied by means of the culture of RAW264.7 macrophages. The microspheres were implanted in a 3 mm-diameter defect in the trochlea of the femoral condyle of New Zealand rabbits, covering them with a poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) membrane manufactured by electrospinning. Experimental groups included a group where exclusively PLLA microspheres were implanted, another group where a mixture of 50/50 microspheres of PLLA (hydrophobic and rigid) and others of chitosan (a hydrogel) were used, and a third group used as a control where no material was used and only the membrane was covering the defect. The histological characteristics of the regenerated tissue have been evaluated 3 months after the operation. We found that during the regeneration process the microspheres, and the membrane covering them, are displaced by the neoformed tissue in the regeneration space toward the subchondral bone region, leaving room for the formation of a tissue with the characteristics of hyaline cartilage."

In many valve pathologies, VICs become activated and will subsequently profoundly remodel the valve tissue extracellular matrix (ECM). A primary indicator of VIC activation is the upregulation of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) stress fibers, which in turn increase VIC contractility. Thus, contractile state reflects VIC activation and ECM biosynthesis levels. In general, cell contraction studies have largely utilized two-dimensional substrates, which are a vastly different micro mechanical environment than 3D native leaflet tissue. To address this limitation, hydrogels have been a popular choice for studying cells in a three-dimensional environment due to their tunable properties and optical transparency, which allows for direct cell visualization. In the present study, we extended the use of hydrogels to study the active contractile behavior of VICs. Aortic VICs (AVIC) were encapsulated within poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels and were subjected to flexural-deformation tests to assess the state of AVIC contraction. Using a finite element model of the experimental setup, we determined the effective shear modulus μ of the constructs. An increase in μ resulting from AVIC active contraction was observed. Results further indicated that AVIC contraction had a more pronounced effect on μ in softer gels (72 ± 21% increase in μ within 2.5 kPa gels) and was dependent upon the availability of adhesion sites (0.5-1 mM CRGDS). The transparency of the gel allowed us to image AVICs directly within the hydrogel, where we observed a time-dependent decrease in volume (time constant τ=3.04 min) when the AVICs were induced into a hypertensive state. Our results indicated that AVIC contraction was regulated by both the intrinsic (unseeded) gel stiffness and the CRGDS peptide concentrations. This finding suggests that AVIC contractile state can be profoundly modulated through their local micro environment using modifiable PEG gels in a 3D micromechanical-emulating environment. Moving forward, this approach has the potential to be used towards delineating normal and diseased VIC biomechanical properties using highly tunable PEG biomaterials. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE."

Xenogeneic corneas are anatomically and biomechanically similar to the human cornea, yet their applications require prior decellularization to remove the antigenic components to avoid rejection. In the context of bringing decellularized corneas into clinical use, sterilization is a crucial step that determines the success of the transplantation. Well-standardized sterilization methods, such as gamma irradiation (GI), have been applied to decellularized porcine corneas (DPC) to avoid graft-associated infections in human recipients. However, little is known about the effect of GI on decellularized corneal xenografts. Here, we evaluated the radiation effect on the ultrastructure, optical, mechanical and biological properties of DPC. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that gamma irradiated decellularized porcine cornea (G-DPC) preserved its structural integrity. Moreover, the radiation did not reduce the optical properties of the tissue. Neither DPC nor G-DPC led to further activation of complement system compared to native porcine cornea when exposed to plasma. Although, DPC were mechanically comparable to the native tissue, GI increased the mechanical strength, tissue hydrophobicity and resistance to enzymatic degradation. Despite these changes, human corneal epithelial, stromal, endothelial and hybrid neuroblastoma cells grew and differentiated on DPC and G-DPC. Thus, GI may achieve effective tissue sterilization without affecting critical properties that are essential for corneal transplant survival."

In this study, we developed a silk fibroin (SF) and carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) composite hydrogel with enzymatic cross-links (horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide) and β-sheet cross-links (ethanol treatment). Results of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) verified that SF/CMCS composite hydrogels had a tunable β-sheet structure. Therefore, by increasing the time of ethanol treatment from 0 h to 8 h, a series of parameters including pore size (from 50 to 300 μm), equilibrium swelling (from 78.1 ± 2.6% to 91.9 ± 0.9%), degradation (from 100% to 9% reduction in mass over 56 days), rheological properties (storage modulus from 177 Pa to 88,904 Pa), and mechanical properties (compressive modulus from 13 to 829 kPa) of the hydrogels were adjusted. In particular, the material parameters of the hydrogels with 2 h ethanol treatment appeared most suitable for engineered cartilage. Furthermore, the in vitro cellular experiments showed that the hydrogels supported the adhesion, proliferation, glycosaminoglycan synthesis, and chondrogenic phenotype of rabbit articular chondrocytes. Finally, subcutaneous implantation of the hydrogels in mice showed no infections or local inflammatory responses, indicating a good biocompatibility in vivo. In conclusion, the chemical-physical cross-linking SF/CMCS composite hydrogels, with tunable material properties and degradation rate, good biocompatibility, are promising scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering."
posterior scleral reinforcement prevent progression high myopia,TISSUE/BIOMATERIAL,20.7% TISSUE/BIOMATERIAL; 13.9% ORTHOPAEDICS/SURGERY; 9.5% ORTHOPAEDICS/SPINE,"Huang W, Duan A, Qi Y,","*Asia-Pacific journal of ophthalmology (Philadelphia, Pa.)*",* [Posterior Scleral Reinforcement to Prevent Progression of High Myopia.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513040),Posterior Scleral Reinforcement to Prevent Progression of High Myopia.,"Myopia has become a global public health problem. High myopia is linked to pathologic myopia (PM). As the severity of myopia increases, excessive axial elongation of the globe exerts a biomechanical stretch on the posterior pole, followed by a series of retinopathy which can lead to marked visual impairment. Posterior scleral reinforcement (PSR) is the only way that may have the potential to prevent the progression of axial elongation. Some scholars expressed satisfaction with the efficacy and safety of PSR. In contrast, other surgeons had negative conclusions on the outcomes for the surgery."
