Of the ""less familiar"" bone types whose study was advocated by John Currey to gain a better understanding of structure-function relationships of mineralized tissues and organs, antlers were of special interest to him. The present review summarizes our current knowledge about the evolution, development, structure, mineralization, and biomechanics of antlers and how their formation is affected by environmental factors like nutrition. Furthermore, the potential role of antlers as a model in bone biology and several fields of biomedicine as well as their use as a monitoring tool in environmental studies are discussed."

Resveratrol (RES) promotes osteoblast proliferation and inhibits osteoclast proliferation and positively affects bone regeneration; however, reports about effects of RES on osseointegration in aged female rats with ALH consumption are limited. This study was designed to investigate the impact of treatment with RES on osseointegration for aged female rats with ALH consumption. This study included 30 female Sprague-Dawley rats (22 months old), weighing approximately 520 g. All animals were randomly divided into 3 groups of 10: a control group (CON) receiving saline, a group receiving ALH and a group receiving ALH + RES until death after 12 weeks. The results of enhanced osseointegration in senile female rats with RES consumption were evaluated by histology, microcomputerized tomography (micro-CT), gene expression analysis and a biomechanical test. The results of this study indicated that ALH + RES showed stronger effects on the improvement of osseointegration in senile female rats with ALH consumption. The ALH + RES produced stronger effects on bone volume per total volume (BV/TV), mean trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), mean trabecular number (Tb.N) and mean trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), connective tissue density (Conn.D) and maximum push-out force for implants, and regulation of osteogenesis and bone resorption-related gene expression. These results seem to indicate that RES intervention reverses the negative effect of alcohol on hydroxyapatite-coated implant osseointegration in senile female rats with ALH consumption."
sensorimotor coding vermal granule neurons developing mammalian cerebellum,CARDIOVASCULAR/CARDIOPULMONARY,44.0% CARDIOVASCULAR/CARDIOPULMONARY; 18.4% TISSUE/BIOMATERIAL; 6.2% MODELING,"Markwalter KH, Yang Y, Holy TE, Bonni A,",*The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience*,* [Sensorimotor Coding of Vermal Granule Neurons in the Developing Mammalian Cerebellum.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31235645),Sensorimotor Coding of Vermal Granule Neurons in the Developing Mammalian Cerebellum.,"The vermal cerebellum is a hub of sensorimotor integration critical for postural control and locomotion, but the nature and developmental organization of afferent information to this region have remained poorly understood <i>in vivo</i> Here, we use <i>in vivo</i> two-photon calcium imaging of the vermal cerebellum in awake behaving male and female mice to record granule neuron responses to diverse sensorimotor cues targeting visual, auditory, somatosensory, and motor domains. Use of an activity-independent marker revealed that approximately half (54%) of vermal granule neurons were activated during these recordings. A multikernel linear model distinguished the relative influences of external stimuli and co-occurring movements on neural responses, indicating that, among the subset of activated granule neurons, locomotion (44%-56%) and facial air puffs (50%) were more commonly and reliably encoded than visual (31%-32%) and auditory (19%-28%) stimuli. Strikingly, we also uncover populations of granule neurons that respond differentially to voluntary and forced locomotion, whereas other granule neurons in the same region respond similarly to locomotion in both conditions. Finally, by combining two-photon calcium imaging with birth date labeling of granule neurons via <i>in vivo</i> electroporation, we find that early- and late-born granule neurons convey similarly diverse sensorimotor information to spatially distinct regions of the molecular layer. Collectively, our findings elucidate the nature and developmental organization of sensorimotor information in vermal granule neurons of the developing mammalian brain.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cerebellar granule neurons comprise over half the neurons in the brain, and their coding properties have been the subject of theoretical and experimental interest for over a half-century. In this study, we directly test long-held theories about encoding of sensorimotor stimuli in the cerebellum and compare the <i>in vivo</i> coding properties of early- and late-born granule neurons. Strikingly, we identify populations of granule neurons that differentially encode voluntary and forced locomotion and find that, although the birth order of granule neurons specifies the positioning of their parallel fiber axons, both early- and late-born granule neurons convey a functionally diverse sensorimotor code. These findings constitute important conceptual advances in understanding the principles underlying cerebellar circuit development and function."

In the current study, we performed image-based computational fluid dynamics simulation of the zebrafish embryonic heart ventricles and characterized flow mechanics, organ dynamics, and energy dynamics in detail. 4D scans of 5 days post-fertilization embryonic hearts with GFP-labelled myocardium were acquired using line-scan focal modulation microscopy. This revealed that the zebrafish hearts exhibited a wave-like contractile/relaxation motion from the inlet to the outlet during both systole and diastole, which we showed to be an energy efficient configuration. No impedance pumping effects of pressure and velocity waves were observed. Due to its tube-like configuration, inflow velocities were higher near the inlet and smaller at the outlet and vice versa for outflow velocities. This resulted in an interesting spatial wall shear stress (WSS) pattern where WSS waveforms near the inlet and those near the outlet were out of phase. There was large spatial variability in WSS magnitudes. Peak WSS was in the range of 47.5-130 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup> at the inflow and outflow tracts, but were much smaller, in the range of 4-11 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup>, in the mid-ventricular segment. Due to very low Reynolds number and the highly viscous environment, intraventricular pressure gradients were high, suggesting substantial energy losses of flow through the heart."
mapping spatial variation mitral valve elastic properties using air pulse optical coherence elastography,CARDIOVASCULAR/CARDIOPULMONARY,56.2% CARDIOVASCULAR/CARDIOPULMONARY; 24.4% TISSUE/BIOMATERIAL; 15.3% METHODS,"Vekilov DP, Singh M, Aglyamov SR, Larin KV, Grande-Allen KJ,",*Journal of biomechanics*,* [Mapping the spatial variation of mitral valve elastic properties using air-pulse optical coherence elastography.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300156),Mapping the spatial variation of mitral valve elastic properties using air-pulse optical coherence elastography.,"The mitral valve is a highly heterogeneous tissue composed of two leaflets, anterior and posterior, whose unique composition and regional differences in material properties are essential to overall valve function. While mitral valve mechanics have been studied for many decades, traditional testing methods limit the spatial resolution of measurements and can be destructive. Optical coherence elastography (OCE) is an emerging method for measuring viscoelastic properties of tissues in a noninvasive, nondestructive manner. In this study, we employed air-pulse OCE to measure the spatial variation in mitral valve elastic properties with micro-scale resolution at 1 mm increments along the radial length of the leaflets. We analyzed differences between the leaflets, as well as between regions of the valve. We found that the anterior leaflet has a higher elastic wave velocity, which is reported as a surrogate for stiffness, than the posterior leaflet, most notably at the annular edge of the sample. In addition, we found a spatial elastic gradient in the anterior leaflet, where the annular edge was found to have a greater elastic wave velocity than the free edge. This gradient was less pronounced in the posterior leaflet. These patterns were confirmed using established uniaxial tensile testing methods. Overall, the anterior leaflet was stiffer and had greater heterogeneity in its mechanical properties than the posterior leaflet. This study measures differences between the two mitral leaflets with greater resolution than previously feasible and demonstrates a method that may be suitable for assessing valve mechanics following repair or during the engineering of synthetic valve replacements."

Most macrophage cell surface receptors are glycoproteins with sialic acids at the terminal of their glycans. It is well recognized that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces cell surface sialylation changes that may in turn contribute to macrophage functions. In addition, cellular mechanics such as elasticity is also a major determinant of macrophage function, which in turn is modulated by LPS. In this report, we characterized the sialylation status of macrophages upon LPS stimulation and assessed the changes in its mechanical properties and function. Specifically, we confirmed that sialylation status is closely related to macrophage biomechanical characteristics (elastic modulus, tether force, tether radius, adhesion force, and membrane tension) and thus directly involved in macrophage function. Further, we modulated macrophage sialylation status by feeding the cell with exogenous free sialic acid (Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc) and sialidase inhibitors, and examined the resulting effects on cellular mechanics and function. A systematic recognition of sialylation status related to cellular mechanics of macrophages will contribute to defining their phenotypes and elucidate macrophage functional diversity."

Bioassay-guided purification led to the identification of 14 meroterpenoids including six new metabolites, arisugacins L-Q (<b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>8</b>, and <b>12</b>-<b>14</b>), seven known arisugacins (<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>9</b>, and <b>10</b>), and one known terreulactone (<b>11</b>). Their structures were determined using a combination of NMR and HRESIMS data, evidence secured from theoretical and experimental ECD spectra, and the modified Mosher's method. The purified compounds were tested in zebrafish embryos, as well as in vitro for cholinesterase inhibition activities. Compound <b>12</b> produced defects in myotome structure (metameric muscle, which is critical for locomotion) in vivo and showed the most potent and selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 191 nM in vitro. The phenotype assay was also used to reveal bioactivities for several previously reported arisugacins, which had failed to show activity in prior cell-based and in vitro testing. This study demonstrates that utilization of the zebrafish phenotype assay is an effective approach for the identification of bioactive extracts, is compatible with the bioassay-guided compound purification strategies, and offers a valuable tool for probing complex natural product sources to detect bioactive small molecules with potential therapeutic or other commercial applications."

Herein, by introducing the synthesis of active ""patchy"" colloids of various low-symmetry shapes, we demonstrate that the dynamics of such systems can be precisely tuned. The low-symmetry patchy colloids are made in bulk via a cluster-encapsulation-dewetting method. They carry essential information encoded in their shapes (particle geometry, number, size, and configurations of surface patches, etc.) that programs their locomotive and assembling behaviors. Under AC electric field, we show that the velocity of particle propulsion and the ability to brake and steer can be modulated by having two asymmetrical patches with various bending angles. The assembly of mono-patch particles leads to the formation of dynamic and reconfigurable structures such as spinners and ""cooperative swimmers"" depending on the particle's aspect ratios. Particle with two patches of different sizes allows ""directional bonding"", a concept popular in static assemblies but rare in dynamic ones. With the capability to make tunable and complex shapes, we anticipate the discovery of a diverse range of new dynamics and structures when other external stimuli (e.g., magnetic, optical, chemical, etc.) are employed and spark synergy with shapes."

All cilia and flagella contain a microtubule-based structure called the axoneme. In motile cilia and flagella, which drive cell locomotion and fluid transport, the axoneme contains, along most of its length, motor proteins from the axonemal dynein family. These motor proteins drive motility by using energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to generate a bending wave, which travels down the axoneme. As a first step toward visualizing the ATPase activity of the axonemal dyneins during bending, we have investigated the kinetics of nucleotide binding to axonemes. Using a specially built ultraviolet total internal reflection fluorescence microscope, we found that the fluorescent ATP analog methylanthraniloyl ATP (mantATP), which has been shown to support axonemal motility, binds all along isolated, immobilized axonemes. By studying the recovery of fluorescence after photobleaching, we found that there are three mantATP binding sites: one that bleaches rapidly (time constant ≈ 1.7 s) and recovers slowly (time constant ≈ 44 s), one that bleaches with the same time constant but does not recover, and one that does not bleach. By reducing the dynein content in the axoneme using mutants and salt extraction, we provide evidence that the slow-recovering component, but not the other components, corresponds to axonemal dyneins. The recovery rate of this component, however, is too slow to be consistent with the activation of beating observed at higher mantATP concentrations; this indicates that the dyneins may be inhibited due to their immobilization at the surface. The development of this method is a first step toward direct observation of the traveling wave of dynein activity."

One of the interesting properties of collagen is to self-associate into fibrils. The present work aims to direct the self-assembly of collagen through different molecular forces, which are tuned on the addition of thymoquinone a well-known phytochemical. A change in relative viscosity and stress of collagen-thymoquinone blends influenced the interfibrillar aggregates around its hydration shell. Further, secondary structural integrity was studied via cotton curve effect, and vibrational frequency shifts showed a characteristic interaction of thymoquinone at the N-terminal residues of the triple helix. Finally, the spontaneous self-association of fibrils was tracked by calculating the rate of fibril growth kinetics, which potentially decreased with increase in thymoquinone concentration. The fibrils were eventually visualized under the high resolution-scanning microscope showing morphological variations. Therefore, such a protein-phytochemical interaction may tend to play with the hydration network of collagen and covalently interact with its imino acid residues. It may be speculated that such an inhibitory process portrayed by thymoquinone may have a fortune in the targeted and sustainable delivery to the site of action for certain diseases, which includes collagen accumulation. Moreover, its directed assembly could be utilized for designing templates as in manipulating the collagen as a nanoporous membrane to make nanofibers and further tuned by small molecules for nanoparticle synthesis application."

In this research, discovery of fluorescent NPs in roasted pork was reported at different temperature of 180, 230, and 280 °C. The size of the pork NPs was in the range of 5.93-7.49 nm. The FTIR and XPS analysis showed that the NPs are made up of graphitic carbon (sp2) and carbon defects (sp3), with abundant hydroxyl and carbonyl groups on the surface. The Ussing chamber test clearly showed the pork NPs had permeability passing through intestine. Significant fluorescence quenching of NPs was observed in the digestion <i>in vitro</i>. The bio-distribution of NPs in mice indicated that they obviously presented in liver, kidney and testis, even crossed the blood-brain barrier, entering into the brain. The oral administration of pork NPs at a dose of 2 g/kg mouse body weight did not caused obvious toxicity in BALB/c mice. However, significant influence of the NP exposure was observed on locomotion behaviors and lifespans in wild type <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>."

Yet, how does lesion level affect SCI-induced motor and sensory dysfunctions remains unclear. Using a computer-controlled impactor (Impact One™, Leica) and the same parameters (diameter, 2.0 mm; Speed: 4.0 m/s; Depth: 1.5 mm; Dwell time: 0.1 s), we produced contusions at mid-thoracic (T10) and rostral-lumbar (L2) spinal cord in male rats, and compared locomotor and sensory dysfunctions within the same experimental setting. The time courses of locomotor deficit were comparable between thoracic (n = 8) and lumbar (n = 7) SCI rats, but the severity was greater after thoracic SCI especially during the first week post-injury, as indicated by the lower Basso, Beattle and Bresnahan open-field locomotion scores. Both groups showed similar heightened avoiding response (hyper-reactivity) to mechanical stimulation applied at the hindpaws from day 21-56 post-injury, as indicated by decreased paw withdrawal thresholds. Compared to lumbar SCI, thoracic SCI induced a greater decrease of paw withdrawal latency in hot-plate test from day 28-56 post-injury. In contrast, lumbar SCI rats showed a greater reduction of avoidance threshold to mechanical stimulation at the girdle region, and larger overgroomed area than thoracic SCI rats at day 14 post-injury. Thus, thoracic SCI may induce greater motor deficits and hindpaw heat hyper-reactivity than did lumbar SCI. In contrast, lumbar SCI may elicit greater at-level mechanical hyper-reactivity and overgrooming behavior than thoracic SCI. Future study needs to examine the specific pathological changes underlying different dysfunctions in two SCI models."

Yet the molecules that shape the brain's biomechanical properties are unidentified and the relationship between neural development and viscoelasticity of brain tissue remains elusive. Here we combined novel in-vivo tomoelastography and ex-vivo proteomics to investigate whether viscoelasticity of the mouse brain correlates with protein alterations within the critical phase of brain maturation. For the first time, high-resolution atlases of viscoelasticity of the mouse brain were generated, revealing that (i)brain stiffness increased alongside progressive accumulation of microtubular structures, myelination, cytoskeleton linkage and cell-matrix attachment, and that (ii) viscosity-related tissue fluidity decreased alongside downregulated actin crosslinking and axonal organization. Taken together, our results show that brain maturation is associated with a shift of brain mechanical properties towards a more solid-rigid behavior consistent with reduced tissue fluidity. This shift appears to be driven by several molecular processes associated with myelination, cytoskeletal crosslinking and axonal organization."

However, in some species, the behavioral patterns recorded in artificial conditions contrast greatly with observed wild-type behavioral rhythms. In this study, we identify the determinants of daily activity rhythms of the soft and stone fruit pest <i>Drosophila suzukii</i>. The impact of gender, space, social housing, temperature, light, fly morph, and the circadian clock on <i>D. suzukii</i> locomotor rhythms was investigated. Assays were performed under artificial laboratory conditions or more natural semifield conditions to identify how these factors affected daily locomotor behavior. Daily locomotor activity patterns collected under semifield conditions varied very little between the various sex and social condition combinations. However, in lab-based assays, individual and group-housed males often exhibited divergent activity patterns, with more prominent hyperactivity at light/dark transitions. In contrast, hyperactivity responses were suppressed under lab protocols mimicking summer conditions for groups of females and mixed-sex groups. Moreover, when environmental cues were removed, flies held in groups displayed stronger rhythmicity than individual flies. Thus, social interactions can reinforce circadian behavior and resist hyperactivity responses in <i>D. suzukii</i>. Fly morph appeared to have little impact on behavioral pattern, with winter and summer morph flies displaying similar activity profiles under April semifield and laboratory mimic environmental conditions. In conclusion, separate and combined effects of light, temperature, circadian clock function, and social interactions were apparent in the daily activity profiles of <i>D. suzukii</i>. When groups of female or mixed-sex flies were used, implementation of matching photoperiods and realistic daily temperature gradients in the lab was sufficient to re-create behavioral patterns observed in summer semifield settings. The ability to leverage lab assays to predict <i>D. suzukii</i> field behavior promises to be a valuable asset in improving control measures for this pest."

In order to stay airborne, its flexible hindwings are flapped so as to work as a thrust generator. However, the wing loading of the beetle is relatively large (38.94±3.73 N.m&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) compared to those of other insects and hummingbirds, indicating that it is challenging for it to achieve flight. Here, we measured the hindwing morphology and kinematics of the beetle in order to discover its flight performance. Unlike many other insects, the beetle flaps its hindwings with an extremely large sweep amplitude of about 191.33±6.12 deg at high flapping frequencies ranging from 36 to 41 Hz (mean wing tip speed ≈ 13.45±0.58 m.s&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;). These capabilities enable the beetle to produce enough lift force to stay airborne with its bulky body (4 - 10 g). In order to investigate how the sweep amplitude affects the beetle's flight efficiency, we utilized the unsteady blade element model to estimate the power requirements of the same vertical force production for various sweep amplitudes. The results indicate that the sweep amplitude as high as 190 deg is more beneficial for power requirements than the smaller amplitudes, which require higher frequencies resulting in higher inertial powers to produce the same vertical force. Thus, for this large beetle, high sweep amplitude may be a biological strategy for staying airborne. In addition, we thoroughly discussed the effects of input constraints on the outcome by investigating power loadings for variable sweep amplitudes at a constant vertical force, wing tip speed, and flapping frequency. Effect of wing surface area was also investigated and discussed to provide useful information for the development of an insect-inspired flapping-wing robot."

It is thus indispensable to understand the drivers, constraints and dynamics that lead to the emergence and modification of building behaviour. Here, we demonstrate that spider web diversification repeatedly followed strikingly similar evolutionary trajectories, guided by physical constraints. We found that the evolution of suspended webs that intercept flying prey coincided with small changes in silk anchoring behaviour with considerable effects on the robustness of web attachment. The use of nanofiber based capture threads (cribellate silk) conflicts with the behavioural enhancement of web attachment, and the repeated loss of this trait was frequently followed by physical improvements of web anchor structure. These findings suggest that the evolution of building behaviour may be constrained by major physical traits limiting its role in rapid adaptation to a changing environment.

We performed detailed dissections and brought to light specific anatomical features of kiwi, in comparison with other ratites and neognathous birds. Our osteological study revealed a strongly curved pelvis, a rigid tail, and enlarged ribs. Our myology study showed an unusual location of the caudofemoralis muscle origin and insertion. The insertion of the pars pelvica along the entire caudal face of the femur, contrasts with the proximal insertion usually seen in other birds. Additionally, the pars caudalis originates along the entire tail, whereas it only inserts on the uropygium in the other birds. To interpret these specificities from a functional point of view, we built three-dimensional osteomuscular models based on computed tomography scans, radiographies and our dissections. We chose three postures associated with reproductive constraints: the standing position of a gravid compared with a non-gravid bird, as well as the brooding position. The 3D model of the brooding position suggested that the enlarged ribs could support the bodyweight when leaning on the huge egg in both males and females. Moreover, we found that in gravid females, the unusual shape of the pelvis and tail allowed the huge egg to sit ventrally below the pelvis, whereas it is held closer to the rachis in other birds. The specific conformation of the limb and the insertions of the two parses of the caudofemoralis help to maintain the tail flexed, and to keep the legs adducted when carrying the egg. The caudal location of the hip and its flexed position explains the long stance phase during the strange gait of kiwi, revealing the functional trade-off between reproduction and locomotion in this emblematic New Zealand bird."

To address this issue, ethanol-induced conditioned place aversion (CPA) was tested in a genetically diverse panel of 15 inbred mouse strains. Mice were exposed to an unbiased place conditioning procedure using ethanol doses of 0, 2, or 4 g/kg; all injections were given immediately after 5-min exposure to distinctive tactile cues. There were dose-dependent effects of ethanol on CPA and on the change in pre-injection activity rates between the first and last conditioning trials. Most strains (80%) developed CPA, demonstrating the generalizability of this behavior. Moreover, genotype had significant effects on CPA magnitude and locomotor activity rates. Strain means from this study and previously published studies were then used to examine genetic correlations. These analyses showed significant genetic correlations between CPA and ethanol intake/preference, conditioned taste aversion, and drug withdrawal (but not blood ethanol concentration or conditioned place preference), supporting the idea of commonality in the genes underlying CPA and each of these behaviors. The overall pattern of findings is consistent with previous data suggesting that genetic differences in sensitivity to ethanol's aversive effects play a role in determining strain differences in ethanol drinking. The broader implication is that individuals who are more sensitive to the aversive effects of ethanol may be protected from developing the excessive drinking behaviors characteristic of alcohol use disorders."

A model for understanding the solutions to these physical problems, the American horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus), is a marine arthropod that mates in the intertidal zone, where it must contend with strong ambient flows to maintain its orientation during locomotion and reproduction. Possible strategies to maintain position include either negative lift generation or the minimization of positive lift in flow. To quantify flow over the shell and the forces generated, we laser-scanned the 3D shape of a horseshoe crab, and the resulting digital reconstruction was used to 3D-print a physical model. We then recorded the movement of tracking particles around the shell model with high-speed video and analyzed the time-lapse series using particle image velocimetry (PIV). The velocity vector fields from PIV were used to validate numerical simulations performed with the immersed boundary (IB) method. IB simulations allowed us to resolve the forces acting on the shell, as well as the local three-dimensional flow velocities and pressures. Both IB simulations and PIV analysis of vorticity and velocity at a flow speed of 13 cm/s show negative lift for negative and zero angles of attack, and positive lift for positive angles of attack in a free-stream environment. In shear flow simulations, we found near-zero lift for all orientations tested. Because horseshoe crabs are likely to be found primarily at near-zero angles of attack, we suggest that this negative lift helps maintain the orientation of the crab during locomotion and mating. This study provides a preliminary foundation for assessing the relationship between documented morphological variation and potential environmental variation for distinct populations of horseshoe crabs along the Atlantic Coast. It also motivates future studies which could consider the stability of the horseshoe crab in unsteady, oscillating flows."

The middle legs are 20% longer and the hind legs 60% longer than the front legs. A jump starts with the middle and hind legs in variable positions, but together by depressing their coxo-trochanteral and extending their femoro-tibial joints they accelerate the body in 16-19 ms to mean take-off velocities of 0.7 - 0.8 m s<sup>-1</sup>; performances in males and females were not significantly different. Depression of the wings accompanies these leg movements, but clipping them does not affect jump performance. Smooth transition to flapping flight occurs once airborne with little loss of energy to body rotation. 90 % of the jumps analysed occurred without an observable stimulus; the remaining 10 % were in response to a mechanical touch.

To test the hypothesis that a low core body temperature (Tc) constitutes a thrifty metabolic trait underlying the high metabolic efficiency driving catch-up fat, the Anipill® system - with the telemetry capsules implanted in the peritoneal cavity - was used for continuous monitoring of Tc for several weeks in a validated rat model of semistarvation-refeeding in which catch-up fat is driven solely by suppressed thermogenesis. In animals housed at 22°C, 24h Tc was reduced in response to semistarvation (-0.77°C, p<0.001), and remained significantly lower than in controls during the catch-up fat phase of refeeding (-0.27°C on average, p<0.001); the lower Tc during refeeding being more pronounced during the light phase than during the dark phase of the 24h cycle (-0.30°C vs -0.23°C, p<0.01), and with no between-group differences in locomotor activity. A lower 24h Tc in animal showing catch-up fat was also observed when the housing temperature was raised to 29°C (i.e. at thermoneutrality). The reduced energy cost of homeothermy in response to caloric restriction persists during weight recovery, and constitutes a thrifty metabolic trait that contributes to the high metabolic efficiency that underlies the rapid restoration of the body's fat stores during weight regain, with implications for obesity relapse after therapeutic slimming and the pathophysiology of catch-up growth."

Differential behaviors of male and female insects may contribute to such population explosions. However, the key olfactory mechanisms underlying different behaviors associated with sex-related pheromones are unclear. Here, we report that male-specific odor, 2-heptanone plays different roles in relation to the behavior of migratory locust males and females, and that this sexual dimorphism involves a soluble odorant-binding protein (OBP) in the peripheral olfactory processes. This odor strongly binds to LmigOBP4, a novel OBP, present in antennal trichoid sensilla, and elicits opposite locomotor tendencies between the sexes: attracting females and repelling males. Furthermore, an adult male group mimicked a high dosage of 2-heptanone by promoting their attractiveness to single females. Additionally, RNAi suppression of Lmigobp4 expression reduced the physiological responses to 2-heptanone to levels that were indistinguishable between the sexes. This suppression reversed the adult behavioral responses to 2-heptanone, i.e., females were repelled and males were attracted. We conclude that LmigOBP4 is associated with olfactory recognition of male-specific 2-heptanone, which plays dual roles that differ between adult male and female migratory locusts."

The present study evaluated the stress distribution in 3-unit fixed partial dentures supported by two implants with different inclinations and prosthetic abutments. UCLAs or mini abutments were used considering 17º of implant angulation in different directions (mesial, distal, buccal, or lingual). To do so, three-dimensional finite element models were built and exported to a specific analysis software. Forces were applied to the functional cusps. Data was obtained in regard of maximum principal and von Mises stresses, in MPa. No relevant differences were observed in the stress values in the cortical and cancellous bone, and in the prosthesis with UCLA or mini abutments. However, a relevant stress reduction in the prosthetic screws of the tilted implant was observed when using UCLA abutments. According to the obtained results, it is possible to suggest that both, UCLA or mini abutments can be used for 3-unit fixed partial dentures when one of the implants is tilted. UCLA abutment might lead to less biomechanical problems related to screw loosening or fracture."

Previous studies have shown that, in fatigue failure and damage of cartilage and fibrocartilage, shear loads could be one of the biggest contributors to the failure. The aim of the present study is to develop an evaluation method to study shear properties of the disc and to do a mathematical characterization of it. For the experiments, twelve porcine discs were used. Each disc was dissected from the TMJ and, then, static strain control tests were carried out to obtain the shear relaxation modulus for the central region of the discs. From the results, it was found that the disc presents a viscoelastic behavior under shear loads. Relaxation modulus decreased with time. Shear relaxation was 10% of the instantaneous stress, which implies that the viscous properties of the disc cannot be neglected. The present results lead to a better understanding of the discs mechanical behavior under realistic TMJ working conditions."

Method The pattern of spatial tongue-jaw coupling was derived from 11 individuals with ALS and 11 healthy controls using the parallel factor analysis. Two articulatory components, which correspond to tongue displacement independent of the jaw (iTongue) and jaw contribution to tongue displacement (cJaw), were extracted from the composite tongue-jaw displacement. These articulatory components were correlated with F1 (i.e., height) and F2-F1 (i.e., advancement) of 4 vowels (/i/, /u/, /æ/, and /ɔ/) across all participants in each group. In addition, a comprehensive index of functional tongue-jaw coupling was derived as the ratio of cJaw/(iTongue + cJaw), and an acoustic index of vowel distortion (VowelDis) was derived to quantify the overall disease-related changes in phonetic distinctiveness of vowels. Based on these indices, disease-related changes in tongue-jaw coupling and phonetic distinctiveness of vowels were examined in individuals at the early, middle, and late stages of the disease. Results For healthy controls, both iTongue and cJaw contributed to F2-F1, while only cJaw contributed to F1. For individuals with ALS, both iTongue and cJaw contributed to F1, whereas only cJaw contributed to F2-F1. Disease-related changes in tongue-jaw coupling included (a) an overall decrease of the percent contribution of the tongue to the composite tongue-jaw displacement accompanied by an increase of percent contribution of the jaw and (b) several changes in the direction of tongue and jaw displacements occurred at different stages of the disease. These disease-related changes in tongue-jaw coupling had various impacts on phonetic distinctiveness of vowels, resulting in (a) a backward shift of front vowels and reduced front-back vowel contrasts, which occurred early and throughout the disease stages; (b) raising of all vowels during the middle stage of the disease; and (c) reduced high-low vowel contrasts during the late stage of the disease. Overall, phonetic distinctiveness of vowels deteriorated progressively throughout the disease course. Conclusions Different from healthy controls who established optimal functional coupling between the tongue and the jaw during vowel productions, individuals at the early-to-middle stages of bulbar ALS showed various adaptive changes in tongue-jaw coupling in response to the disease-related biomechanical and muscular changes in the articulators (particularly in the tongue). These adaptive changes in tongue-jaw coupling were found to be partially effective in mitigating the negative effect of articulatory involvement on phonetic distinctiveness of vowels. As the disease progressed to the late stage, such adaptations appeared to be no longer evident, resulting in a substantial overall reduction of vowel contrasts."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an orthosis inspired by the concept of a foot's twisted osteoligamentous plate on the kinematics of foot-ankle complex. Thirty-five subjects underwent a kinematic assessment of the foot-ankle complex during walking using three different orthoses: (1) Twisted Plate Spring (TPS) orthosis: inspired by the concept of a twisted osteoligamentous plate shape and made with a spring-like material (carbon fiber); (2) Flat orthosis: control orthosis made of a non-elastic material with a non-inclined surface; and (3) Rigid orthosis: control orthosis made of a non-elastic material, with the same shape of the TPS. Repeated measures analyses of variance demonstrated that the TPS reduced the duration and magnitude of rearfoot eversion (p ≤ 0.03), increased rearfoot inversion relative to shank (p < 0.01), increased forefoot eversion relative to rearfoot (p < 0.01), and increased peak of plantar flexion of forefoot relative to rearfoot during the propulsive phase (p = 0.01) compared to Flat orthosis. The effects of the TPS were different from the Rigid orthosis, demonstrating that, alongside shape, material properties were a determinant factor for the obtained results. The findings of this study help clarify the role of a mechanism similar to a twisted osteoligamentous plate on controlling foot pronation and facilitating supination during the stance phase of walking."

Though full rotation is no longer a technical challenge, physical translation is still restricted through limited tracked areas. While rotational information has been shown to be important, the benefit of the translational component is still unclear with mixed results in previous work. To address this gap, we conducted a mixed-method experiment to compare four levels of translational cues and control: none (using the trackpad of the HTC Vive controller to translate), upper-body leaning (sitting on a ""NaviChair"", leaning the upper-body to locomote), whole-body leaning/stepping (standing on a platform called NaviBoard, leaning the whole body or stepping one foot off the center to navigate), and full translation (physically walking). Results showed that translational cues and control had significant effects on various measures including task performance, task load, and simulator sickness. While participants performed significantly worse when they used a controller with no embodied translational cues, there was no significant difference between the NaviChair, NaviBoard, and actual walking. These results suggest that translational body-based motion cues and control from a low-cost leaning/stepping interface might provide enough sensory information for supporting spatial updating, spatial awareness, and efficient locomotion in VR, although future work will need to investigate how these results might or might not generalize to other tasks and scenarios."

Twelve male collegiate students (heel-strikers) performed walking at 1.5 m/s, jogging at 2.5 m/s, and running at 3.5 m/s. A custom-made sliding platform was used to provide the different shear cushion conditions. The shear cushion conditions were fixed (a fixed platform; control group), stiff (K = 2746 N/m), medium stiff (K = 2256 N/m), medium soft (K = 1667 N/m), and soft (K = 1079 N/m). The results showed that all cushion conditions produced sliding displacement and delayed the TPPSF during walking, jogging, and running compared with fixed condition. The APLR and MPLR were lowest under medium soft condition during walking, while the PPSF was similar between medium soft and soft conditions. For jogging and running, the PPSF as well as APLR and MPLR were the lowest under medium stiff condition except the maximum PLR was similar among stiff, medium stiff, and medium soft conditions during running. In conclusion, shear cushion produces appropriate sliding displacement and effectively delays the TPPSF to provide the musculoskeletal system additional time to absorb the impact and reduce loading. The present study demonstrates optimal stiffness of shear cushion at different traveling speeds and suggests that a shear cushion system can be applied in future designs of cushion structures."

Geometrical parameters, assessed from anteroposterior and axial radiograms, were used as input to models for resultant hip force and contact hip stress. Results confirm previous indications that head enlargement after the Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease compensates the values of hip stress. Furthermore, it was found that an increased risk for coxarthritis development after the disease is secondary to concomitant hip dysplasia, with considerable and statistically significantly lower centre-edge angle and unfavourable distribution of stress."

Traditionally, this analysis has relied on captive laboratory force plates and associated downstream biomechanical modeling, and many researchers have approached the problem of portability by extrapolating models built on linear statistics. An alternative approach would be to capitalize on recent advances in deep learning. In this study, using the pre-trained CaffeNet convolutional neural network (CNN) model, multivariate regression of marker-based motion capture to 3D KJM for three sports-related movement types were compared. The strongest overall mean correlation to source modeling of 0.8895 was achieved over the initial 33% of stance phase for sidestepping. The accuracy of these mean predictions of the three critical KJM associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury demonstrate the feasibility of on-field knee injury assessment using deep learning in lieu of laboratory embedded force plates. This multidisciplinary research approach significantly advances machine representation of real-world physical models with practical application for both community and professional level athletes."

While these systems are excellent at providing positional information, they suffer from a limited ability to accurately provide fundamental quantities such as velocity and acceleration (hence forces and torques) during high-speed motion typical of many sports. Conventional optical systems require considerable setup time, can exhibit sensitivity to extraneous light, and generally sample too slowly to accurately capture extreme bursts of athletic activity. In recent years, wireless wearable sensors have begun to penetrate devices used in sports performance assessment, offering potential solutions to these limitations. This article, after determining pressing problems in sports that such sensors could solve and surveying the state-of-the-art in wearable motion capture for sports, presents a wearable dual-range inertial and magnetic sensor platform that we developed to enable an end-to-end investigation of high-level, very wide dynamic-range biomechanical parameters. We tested our system on collegiate and elite baseball pitchers, and have derived and measured metrics to glean insight into performance-relevant motion. As this was, we believe, the first ultra-wide-range wireless multipoint and multimodal inertial and magnetic sensor array to be used on elite baseball pitchers, we trace its development, present some of our results, and discuss limitations in accuracy from factors such as soft-tissue artifacts encountered with extreme motion. In addition, we discuss new metric opportunities brought by our systems that may be relevant for the assessment of micro-trauma in baseball."

Several studies applied a proportionality scheme based on the combination of a pressure- and force platform. A recent study highlighted distinct errors in the partitioning of shear forces when using this proportionality scheme. To date, the impact of this shear force partitioning error analysis on joint moment calculations using inverse dynamic calculations in pathological gait is not known. Hence, the goal of this study was to investigate the clinical applicability of an existing proportionality scheme by extending the shear force partitioning error analysis towards joint moment calculations. Both healthy (n = 10) and pathological gait (n = 10) was assessed using (I) an adjacent force plate method and (II) the estimation method based on an existing proportionality scheme. A correction factor matrix was developed to compensate for the shear force partitioning errors in the estimation method. Extending the shear force partitioning error analysis towards joint moments using inverse dynamic calculations, did not reveal significant differences when comparing corrected joint moments with the estimated joint moments in both healthy and pathological gait."

A randomized crossover design was chosen. The study results imply that the performance and safety potential of a microprocessor-controlled knee joint can be associated with the individual control algorithms and the technological concepts that are implemented to generate motion resistances for controlling flexion and extension movements. When walking with small steps, advantages of the ""default swing"" concept used in the Rheo Knee XC were identified due to a highly reproducible swing phase release. However, when walking backwards, this concept may lead to an uncontrolled knee flexion which partly resulted in falls. When walking down stairs, walking on slopes or while recovering from a stumble after perturbations of the swing phase extension, the C-Leg demonstrated a reliable prosthetic side load-bearing capacity resulting in reduced loading on the residual body. In contrast, the Rheo Knee XC required increased compensatory movements of the remaining locomotor system in order to compensate for reduced load-bearing and safety reserves."

There is a high prevalence of endoscopy-related injury reported in the literature, and studies have demonstrated high-risk biomechanical exposures during the performance of routine colonoscopy. Endoscopy ergonomics focuses on understanding the endoscopist's interaction with the endoscope and the endoscopy unit and re-designing these tasks to minimize risk of endoscopy-related injury. The conversation to date has focused on what the endoscopist can do to minimize his or her risk of injury. It is imperative that we re-frame that discussion because the implication that physicians are responsible for implementing personal or workplace interventions places an undue burden on the physicians and will be the least-effective exposure control method. The endoscope companies need to consider the endoscopist in their design process. As a profession, we need to collectively advocate for endoscopist safety. We offer a perspective on how ergonomic endoscopy can become a realistic and achievable goal."

The articles considered were selected systematically. The effect of differences in design criteria was demonstrated, and it was observed that the impact energy employed during testing dramatically affects the performance of the hip protector. Over the past three decades, researchers have continuously experimented with various systems to determine the efficacy of various hip protectors. The primary aim has been to make informed decisions in optimizing hip protector design. This article provides a systematic review of various test systems employed in the determination of the biomechanical efficacy of hip protectors. A systematic literature search was carried out, and 28 relevant articles were included to demonstrate the effect of test systems in the evaluation of the biomechanical effectiveness of hip protectors. Methodological studies illustrated the appropriate use of impact testing systems for the simulation of hip anatomy and fall dynamics in evaluating the effectiveness of hip protectors in preventing a hip fracture. This systematic review has demonstrated the effect of the variability of test systems on the evaluation of impact attenuation by various hip protectors. The lack of standardized test systems accounts for the inconsistencies in the test results of the efficacy of hip protectors. This has been a major challenge in the efforts of researchers to optimize the interventions. The standardization of test systems may require needed improvements immediately as opposed to the development of new interventions in order to ensure that only hip protectors with adequately proven efficacies are deployed for clinical trials or for the protection of the hips of vulnerable individuals from sideways impact."

We have developed a computationally efficient optimal control framework to predict human gaits based on optimization of a performance criterion without relying on experimental data. The framework generates three-dimensional muscle-driven simulations in 36 min on average-more than 20 times faster than existing simulations-by using direct collocation, implicit differential equations and algorithmic differentiation. Using this framework, we identified a multi-objective performance criterion combining energy and effort considerations that produces physiologically realistic walking gaits. The same criterion also predicted the walk-to-run transition and clinical gait deficiencies caused by muscle weakness and prosthesis use, suggesting that diverse healthy and pathological gaits can emerge from the same control strategy. The ability to predict the mechanics and energetics of a broad range of gaits with complex three-dimensional musculoskeletal models will allow testing novel hypotheses about gait control and hasten the development of optimal treatments for neuro-musculoskeletal disorders."

However, manual propulsion causes biomechanical loads, including contact pressures on the palms of the hands. The hand rim design has received little attention over time, remaining almost unchanged since its creation. This study investigated how two different designs of such devices - one standard and another with a contoured design - influence the contact pressure on the surface of the hands. The procedures included a figure-of-eight shape propulsion task on a regular floor, using both models on a wheelchair. A pressure-mapping system coupled with a pair of fabric gloves recorded the data. The results show that the contoured hand rim provides lower pressure in most of the analysed regions. Considering that manual propulsion is performed during a considerable part of the day as a routine activity, improving the hand rim interface may benefit the user's comfort and safety during wheelchair use. Practitioner Summary: The design of the hand rim used in wheelchair propulsion influences the contact pressure on the hands. Conventional round tube rims tend to concentrate high levels of pressure on the distal phalanges and metacarpal regions. A contoured design generally provides better stability and promotes the distribution of pressure."

Numerous knee kinematic models of different complexity, with either generic or subject-specific anatomy, have been presented and used to predict three-dimensional tibiofemoral (TFJ) and patellofemoral (PFJ) joint kinematics of cadavers or healthy adults, but not pediatric populations. The aims of this study were: (i) to develop subject-specific TFJ and PFJ kinematic models, with TFJ models having either rigid or extensible ligament constraints, for eight healthy pediatric participants and (ii) to validate the estimated joint and ligament kinematics against in vivo kinematics measured from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at four TFJ flexion angles. Three different TFJ models were created from MRIs and used to solve the TFJ kinematics: (i) 5-rigid-link parallel mechanism with rigid surface contact and isometric anterior cruciate (ACL), posterior cruciate (PCL) and medial collateral (MCL) ligaments (ΔL<sub>null</sub>), (ii) 6-link parallel mechanism with minimized ACL, PCL, MCL and lateral collateral ligament (LCL) length changes (ΔL<sub>min</sub>) and (iii) 6-link parallel mechanism with prescribed ACL, PCL, MCL and LCL length variations (ΔL<sub>match</sub>). Each model's geometrical parameters were optimized using a Multiple Objective Particle Swarm algorithm. When compared to MRI-measured data, ΔL<sub>null</sub> and ΔL<sub>match</sub> performed the best, with average root mean square errors below 6.93° and 4.23 mm for TFJ and PFJ angles and displacements, respectively, and below 2.01 mm for ligament lengths (<4.32% ligament strain). Therefore, within these error ranges, ΔL<sub>null</sub> and ΔL<sub>match</sub> can be used to estimate three-dimensional pediatric TFJ, PFJ and ligament kinematics and can be incorporated into lower-limb models to estimate joint kinematics and kinetics during dynamic tasks."

Donut-shaped gel head supports are commonly used to protect the occiput, which is among the most common anatomical sites for PUs; however, the biomechanical efficacy of these devices is unclear. To investigate their effects on scalp tissues, we have used our three-dimensional anatomically realistic finite element model of an adult head, to which we have added a donut-shaped gel head support. We then compared the occipital scalp tissue loads' occurrence while the donut-shaped gel head support is in use with those associated with a fluidised head positioner and a standard medical foam. The donut-shaped gel head support inflicted the greatest exposure to tissue mechanical stresses, particularly to the high (and therefore dangerous) stress domain, when compared to the other positioners. We concluded that while the donut-shaped gel head support is designed to avert tissue loads away from the occiput and disperse them to the surroundings, in practice, it fails to do so. In fact, the donut-shaped gel head support imposes the head-weight forces to transfer through a relatively narrow ring of scalp tissues, hence increasing the risk of developing occipital PUs. KEY MESSAGES: a donut-shaped gel head support is meant to reduce the occurrence of pressure ulcers in scalp tissues to investigate the effects of donut-shaped gel head support on scalp tissues, we have used our anatomically realistic computational model of an adult head the donut-shaped gel head support imposes the head-weight forces to transfer through a relatively narrow ring of scalp tissues the highly distorted and deformed tissues at that ring are at a high risk for injury."

This paper compares two methods that have been presented in the literature to compensate for brain shift: a thin-plate spline deformation model and a finite element method (FEM). For this comparison, both methods are driven by identical sparse data. Specifically, both methods are driven by displacements between automatically detected and matched feature points from intraoperative 3D ultrasound (iUS). Both methods have been shown to be fast enough for intraoperative brain shift correction (Machado et al. in Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg 13(10):1525-1538, 2018; Luo et al. in J Med Imaging (Bellingham) 4(3):035003, 2017). However, the spline method requires no preprocessing and ignores physical properties of the brain while the FEM method requires significant preprocessing and incorporates patient-specific physical and geometric constraints. The goal of this work was to explore the relative merits of these methods on recent clinical data."

Tacrine, a potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, was previously a prescribed clinical therapeutic agent for AD, but it was recently withdrawn because it caused widespread hepatotoxicity. Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) has neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we synthesized a new compound, a tacrine-H<sub>2</sub>S donor hybrid (THS) by introducing H<sub>2</sub>S-releasing moieties (ACS81) to tacrine. Subsequently, pharmacological and biological evaluations of THS were conducted in the aluminum trichloride (AlCl<sub>3</sub>)-induced AD mice model. We found that THS (15 mmol/kg) improved cognitive and locomotor activity in AD mice in the step-through test and open field test, respectively. THS showed strong AChE inhibitory activity in the serum and hippocampus of AD mice and induced increased hippocampal H<sub>2</sub>S levels. Furthermore, THS reduced mRNA expression of the proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β and increased synapse-associated proteins (synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95) in the hippocampus of AD mice. Importantly, THS, unlike tacrine, did not increase liver transaminases (alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase) or proinflammatory cytokines, indicating THS is much safer than tacrine. Therefore, the multifunctional effects of this new hybrid compound of tacrine and H<sub>2</sub>S indicate it is a promising compound for further research into the treatment of AD."

Pharmacokinetic studies in a rat model indicated that, following intraperitoneal dosing, SF-11 crossed the blood-brain barrier and was able to penetrate the brain, making it a suitable tool for behavioral studies. We showed for the first time that SF-11 decreased the immobility time in the forced swim test (FST) after acute peripheral administration (10 and 20 mg/kg), indicating that it has antidepressant potential. Inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways blocked the anti-immobility effect of SF-11, suggesting that these pathways are involved in the antidepressant-like activity of SF-11 in the FST. The results of locomotor activity of rats indicate that the effects observed in the FST are specific and due to the antidepressant-like activity of SF-11. These findings provide further evidence for the antidepressant potential of Y2R antagonists. Also, the application of Fourier transform infrared absorption (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopy (RS) methods combined with theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations allowed us to present the optimized spatial orientation of the investigated drug. Structural characterization of SF-11 based on vibrational spectroscopic data is of great importance and will aid in understanding its biological activity and pave the way for its development as a new antidepressant agent."

Male rats show an augmented striatal dopamine response to methamphetamine following exposure to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Compared to males, female rats have been shown to be highly sensitive to the effects of stimulants and stress independently, however few studies have examined the interaction between stress and stimulants in female rats. Therefore, the current study investigated whether prior exposure to chronic stress potentiated the behavioral and neurochemical responses to an acute injection of methamphetamine in female rats. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were either exposed to CUS or left undisturbed (control) and then two weeks later received an injection of 1.0 or 7.5 mg/kg methamphetamine. Based on open field findings, a subsequent group of rats were exposed to CUS or left undisturbed and then two weeks later received 7.5 mg/kg methamphetamine and either dopamine efflux in the dorsal striatum or nucleus accumbens was measured or methamphetamine and amphetamine levels were measured in the brain and plasma. Female rats exposed to CUS traveled greater distances in the open field immediately following an injection of 7.5 mg/kg, but not 1.0 mg/kg, of methamphetamine and then showed high levels or stereotypy similar to control rats. Animals exposed to CUS had significantly greater increases in dorsal striatum dopamine following an acute injection of 7.5 mg/kg methamphetamine compared to control rats, but not in the nucleus accumbens. These differences were not due to group differences in levels of methamphetamine or amphetamine in the brain or plasma. The current findings demonstrate stress-augmented neurochemical responses to a dose of methamphetamine, similar to that self-administered, which increases understanding of the cross-sensitization between stress and methamphetamine in females."

Our previous study found that the retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway is the signaling pathway most enhanced in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell, a region important for depression, anxiety, and addiction. Genetic manipulations of RA signaling in the NAc affecting addiction-related behavior prompted our study of the role of retinoic acid signaling in depression-related and anxiety-related behavior using in vivo RNA interference. Knockdown of the retinoic acid degradation enzyme cytochrome p450 family 26 subfamily b member 1 (Cyp26b1) in the nucleus accumbens shell increased depression-related behavior while decreasing anxiety-like behavior. Knockdown of the retinoic acid binding protein, cellular RA binding protein 2 (Crabp2), also increased depression-related behavior. Knockdown of another RA binding partner fatty acid binding protein 5 (Fabp5), did not alter these behaviors. These results further support the contention that RA signaling in the NAc shell can affect emotional behavior and that targeting some components of this pathway could be a promising avenue for developing novel treatments for depression and anxiety."

Recently, we have described that supplementation of regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), a chemokine known to drive infiltration of T cells, induces persistent nigrostriatal pathology in MPTP mouse model. However, which particular T cell subsets are recruited to the substantia nigra (SN) by RANTES is not known. Here, by adoptive transfer of different subset of T cells from tomato red transgenic mice to MPTP-intoxicated immunodeficient Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> mice, we describe that invasion of Th17 cells into the SN is stimulated by exogenous RANTES administration. On the other hand, RANTES supplementation remained unable to influence the infiltration of Th1 and Tregs into the SN of MPTP-insulted Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Accordingly, RANTES supplementation increased MPTP-induced TH cell loss in Rag1<sup>-/-</sup>mice receiving Th17, but neither Th1 nor Tregs. RANTES-mediated aggravation of nigral TH neurons also paralleled with significant DA loss in striatum and locomotor deficits in MPTP-intoxicated Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> mice receiving Th17 cells. Finally, we demonstrate that levels of IL-17 (a Th17-specific cytokine) and RANTES are higher in serum of PD patients than age-matched controls and that RANTES positively correlated with IL-17 in serum of PD patients. Together, these results highlight the importance of RANTES-Th17 pathway in progressive dopaminergic neuronal loss and associated PD pathology."

Conversely, amphetamine effects are substantially attenuated after inhibition of dopamine synthesis when most of the dopamine stores are preserved. Such data suggest that amphetamine mobilizes newly synthesized dopamine into extracellular signaling space. The first goal of this project is to determine kinetic parameters of dopamine secretion into and removal from extracellular space compatible with the majority of amphetamine-elicited increases in extracellular dopamine deriving from newly synthesized dopamine. The strategy uses a computational model of extracellular space surrounding a single dopamine varicosity. Model output was compared to published micro-dialysis data for effects of amphetamine on levels of extracellular dopamine. A family of solutions was found, characterized by a biphasic dose-response relationship for rate of dopamine release. Maximum rates of dopamine release occurred at doses of 0.5-1.0 mg/kg amphetamine. The second goal is to develop a hypothesis by which newly synthesized dopamine gains access to extracellular space. The model chosen involves amphetamine-induced shunting of DOPAC secretion to dopamine secretion into extracellular space. The quality of the hypothesis was evaluated by goodness of match of model output to published data for amphetamine alone and after inhibition of dopamine synthesis or storage.

The most important receptors with respect to the rewarding effects of ethanol seem to be the A<sub>2A</sub> receptors. This study used a transgenic strategy, specifically rats overexpressing the A<sub>2A</sub> receptor, to characterize the neurobiological mechanisms of ethanol consumption as measured by intermittent access to 20% ethanol (IAE) in a two-bottle choice paradigm. In this model, no change in ethanol consumption was observed in transgenic animals compared to wild type controls during the acquisition/maintenance phase. Following alcohol deprivation (AD), only transgenic rats overexpressing the A<sub>2A</sub> receptor exhibited escalation of ethanol consumption and drank more (by ca. 90%), but not significantly, ethanol than did the wild type rats. During ethanol withdrawal, the immobility time of rats overexpressing the A<sub>2A</sub> receptor in the forced swim test was lower than that of wild type rats. Moreover, transgenic rats withdrawn from ethanol, compared to the drug-naive transgenic animals, exhibited an increase above 150% in locomotion. The results indicated that the overexpression of A<sub>2A</sub> receptors may be a risk factor for the escalation of ethanol consumption despite the reduction in depression-like signs of ethanol withdrawal."

We extended investigations on L1CAM molecular targets and explored long-distance effects of L1CAM rostral and caudal to complete spinal cord transection (SCT) in adult rats. L1CAM overexpression in neurons and glia after Th10/Th11 SCT was achieved using adeno-associated viral vector serotype 5 (AAV5) injected to L1-lumbar segment immediately after transection. At 5 weeks, L1cam mRNA profound decrease detected rostral and caudal to the transection site was alleviated by AAV5-L1CAM treatment, with increased endogenous L1CAM rostral to SCT. Transected corticospinal tract fibers showed attenuated retraction after treatment, accompanied by a multisegmental increase of lesion-reduced expression of adenylate cyclase 1 (Adcy1), synaptophysin, growth-associated protein 43 and myelin basic protein genes caudal to transection, and Adcy1 rostral to transection. In parallel, chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan phosphacan elevated after SCT was downregulated after treatment. Low-molecular L1CAM isoforms generated after spinalization indicated the involvement of sheddases in L1CAM processing and long-distance effects. ADAM10 sheddase immunoreactivity, stronger in AAV5-L1CAM than AAV5-EGFP-transduced motoneurons indicated local ADAM10 upregulation by L1CAM. The results suggest that increased L1CAM availability and penetration of diffusible L1CAM fragments post-lesion induce both local and long-distance neuronal and glial responses towards better neuronal maintenance, neurite growth and myelination. Despite the fact that intervention has promoted beneficial molecular changes, kinematic analysis of hindlimb movements showed minor improvement, indicating that spinalized rats require longer L1CAM treatment to regain locomotor functions."

Current rTSA testing standards rely upon synthetic bone surrogates, but it is unclear if these models accurately recapitulate the mechanics of osteoporotic bone. Additionally, it also unknown if the use of a central screw effectively provides resistance to micromotion in the milieu of poor quality bone. The purpose of this experiment was to create a novel cyclic load test protocol that elicited clinically relevant failures, so that comparisons of relative motion between baseplates and bones could be made with: (1) synthetic bones and poor quality cadaveric bones, and (2) the use or omission of a central screw. rTSA components were implanted into cadaveric and synthetic bones with and without a central screw. To model a range of loads that may be experienced during abduction, increasing cyclic loads were applied to shoulder joints in 30° of humeral abduction. Cycles and loads prior to permanent deformation exceeding 150 µm, 1 mm, and joint failure were determined using measurements from the test frame and from 3-D motion analysis. Synthetic bones demonstrated significantly more resistance to micromotion in comparison to cadaveric bones. Use of the central screw improved resistance to dislodgement, which was only observed in the cadaveric specimens. This study highlights the need for biomechanical testing with cadaveric specimens, especially when assessing osteopenic or osteoporotic populations."

(Verbenaceae) is used traditionally for its numerous medicinal properties such as antimalarial, antibacterial, anticancer and anti-inflammatory. In the present study, we investigated the chemical composition of essential oil from the leaves of L. camara (LCEO) occurring in the Republic of Benin (West Africa) in comparison with LCEOs from other regions; evaluated its sedative effects in mice via inhalation administration; and identified the compounds responsible for activity. LCEO was extracted by hydrodistillation and chemical analyses of the oil were performed by GC and GC/MS. The oil was dominated by monoterpene hydrocarbons (60.58%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (33.39%), among which sabinene (38.81%) and 1,8-cineole (28.90%) were the most abundant. LCEO administered via inhalation to mice significantly decreased locomotor activity in a dose-dependent manner, mainly at the doses of 0.0004 and 0.04 mg per 400 μL of triethyl citrate (TEC). The oil was fractionated to give two fractions, which were further investigated, and revealed that both sabinene and 1,8-cineole were the principal active compounds. The results of the present study indicated that via inhalation administration, LCEO and its main constituents could be considered as promising candidates for the management of dementia, insomnia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and other central nervous system-associated diseases."

Emerging evidence in rodent models suggests that locomotor responses to a novel inescapable open field may predict behavioral responses to abused drugs; METH produces more potent stimulant effects in high responders to novelty than in low responders. We herein found that mice deficient in protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z (Ptprz-KO) exhibited an enhanced behavioral response to novelty; however, METH-induced hyperlocomotion was significantly lower in Ptprz-KO than in wild-type mice when METH was administered at a non-toxic dose of 1 mg per kg body weight (bdw). Single-cell RT-PCR revealed that the majority of midbrain DA neurons expressed PTPRZ. No histological alterations were observed in the mesolimbic or nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways in Ptprz-KO brains; however, a significant decrease was noted in brain DA turnover, suggesting functional alterations. In vivo microdialysis experiments revealed that METH-evoked DA release in the nucleus accumbens was significantly lower in Ptprz-KO mice than in wild-type mice. Consistent with this result, Ptprz-KO mice showed significantly fewer cell surface DAT as well as weaker DA uptake activity in striatal synaptosomes prepared 1 hr after the administration of METH than wild-type mice, while no significant differences were observed in the two groups treated with saline. These results indicate that the high response phenotype of Ptprz-KO mice to novelty may not be simply attributed to hyper-dopaminergic activity, and that deficits in PTPRZ reduce the effects of METH by reducing DAT activity."

Major drugs of abuse such as amphetamine and cocaine interact with DAT to mediate their effects by enhancing extracellular DA concentrations. We previously identified a novel allosteric site in the related human serotonin transporter that lies outside the central substrate and inhibitor binding pocket. We used the hybrid structure based (HSB) method to screen for allosteric modulator molecules that target a similar site in DAT. We identified a compound, KM822, that was found to be a selective, noncompetitive inhibitor of DAT. We confirmed the structural determinants of KM822 allosteric binding within the allosteric site by structure/function and substituted cysteine scanning accessibility biotinylation experiments. In the in vitro cell-based assay and ex vivo in both rat striatal synaptosomal and slice preparations, KM822 was found to decrease the affinity of cocaine for DAT. The in vivo effects of KM822 on cocaine were tested on psychostimulant-associated behaviors in a planarian model where KM822 specifically inhibited the locomotion elicited by DAT-interacting stimulants amphetamine and cocaine. Overall, KM822 provides a unique opportunity as a molecular probe to examine allosteric modulation of DAT function."

The upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin (Vim), intermediate filament proteins of astrocytes, is the hallmark of astrocyte activation and reactive gliosis in response to injury, ischemia or neurodegeneration. Reactive gliosis is essential for the protective role of astrocytes at acute stages of neurotrauma or ischemic stroke. However, GFAP and Vim were also linked to neural plasticity and regenerative responses in healthy and injured brain. Mice deficient for GFAP and vimentin (GFAP-/-Vim-/-) exhibit increased post-traumatic synaptic plasticity and increased basal and post-traumatic hippocampal neurogenesis. Here we assessed the locomotor and exploratory behavior of GFAP-/-Vim-/- mice, their learning, memory and memory extinction, by using the open field, object recognition and Morris water maze tests, trace fear conditioning, and by recording reversal learning in IntelliCages. While the locomotion, exploratory behavior and learning of GFAP-/-Vim-/- mice, as assessed by object recognition, the Morris water maze, and trace fear conditioning tests, were comparable to wildtype mice, GFAP-/-Vim-/- mice showed more pronounced memory extinction when tested in IntelliCages, a finding compatible with the scenario of an increased rate of reorganization of the hippocampal circuitry."

In this study, we examined behavioral and hippocampal neurogenesis alterations in male offspring of rats exposed to valproic acid (VPA) during pregnancy. Pregnant Wistar rats received daily intraperitoneal injections of VPA (100 mg/kg/day or 200 mg/kg/day) from embryonic day 12.5 until birth. At postnatal day 29, animals received an injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). At postnatal day 30, animals underwent the open field (OF), elevated plus-maze, and Y-maze tests. After behavioral testing, animals were decapitated, and their brains were dissected for immunohistochemistry. Of the offspring of the VPA200 mothers, 66.6% showed a malformation. In the OF test, these animals showed locomotor hyperactivity. In the elevated plus-maze, offspring of VPA-treated mothers spent significantly more time in the open arms, irrespective of the treatment dose. The number of BrdU-positive cells in the dentate gyrus of the offspring of VPA-treated mothers increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner compared with the control. A significant positive correlation between spontaneous locomotor activity in the OF and BrdU-positive cell counts was observed across groups. In conclusion, VPA administration during pregnancy results in malformations and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-like behavioral abnormalities in the offspring. An increase in cell proliferation in the hippocampus may underlie the behavioral changes observed. Repeated use of high doses of VPA during pregnancy may increase the risk of neurodevelopmental abnormalities dose dependently and should be carefully considered."

Across four cohorts of male rats, we used discrete lesions of the mammillothalamic tract to model aspects of diencephalic amnesia and assessed the impact of these lesions on multiple measures of activity and plasticity within the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex. Lesions of the mammillothalamic tract had widespread indirect effects on hippocampocortical oscillatory activity within both theta and gamma bands. Both within-region oscillatory activity and cross-regional synchrony were altered. The network changes were state-dependent, displaying different profiles during locomotion and paradoxical sleep. Consistent with the associations between oscillatory activity and plasticity, complementary analyses using several convergent approaches revealed microstructural changes, which appeared to reflect a suppression of learning-induced plasticity in lesioned animals. Together, these combined findings suggest a mechanism by which damage to the medial diencephalon can impact upon learning and memory processes, highlighting an important role for the mammillary bodies in the coordination of hippocampocortical activity.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Information flow within the Papez circuit is critical to memory. Damage to ascending mammillothalamic projections has consistently been linked to amnesia in humans and spatial memory deficits in animal models. Here we report on the changes in hippocampocortical oscillatory dynamics that result from chronic lesions of the mammillothalamic tract and demonstrate, for the first time, that the mammillary bodies, independently of the supramammillary region, contribute to frequency modulation of hippocampocortical theta oscillations. Consistent with the associations between oscillatory activity and plasticity, the lesions also result in a suppression of learning-induced plasticity. Together, these data support new functional models whereby mammillary bodies are important for coordinating hippocampocortical activity rather than simply being a relay of hippocampal information as previously assumed."

Formosan wood mice, <i>Apodemus semotus</i>, are endemic rodents and are broadly distributed at altitudes between 1400 m and 3700 m in Taiwan. Interestingly, Formosan wood mice show similar locomotor activity in the laboratory as they do in the wild. Hence, we are interested in studying whether exploratory behaviors and central dopaminergic activity are changed in the open field test. We used male C57BL/6J mice as the control, comparing their behavioral responses in the open field, step-down inhibitory avoidance discrimination and novel object recognition tests with those of male Formosan wood mice. We also examined dopamine and its major metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the medial prefrontal cortex, striatum and nucleus accumbens. In open field tests, Formosan wood mice revealed higher levels of locomotion and exploration than C57BL/6J mice. Learning and memory performance in the novel object recognition test was similar in both Formosan wood mice and C57BL/6J mice, but more agile responses in the inhibitory avoidance discrimination task were found in Formosan wood mice. There was no difference in behavioral responses in the open field test between new second-generation Formosan wood mice and Formosan wood mice that were inbred for more than ten generations. After repeated exposure to the open field test, high levels of locomotion and exploration as well as central dopaminergic activities were markedly persistent in Formosan wood mice, but these activities were significantly reduced in C57BL/6J mice. Diazepam (anxiolytic) treatment reduced the higher exploratory activity and central dopaminergic activities in Formosan wood mice, but this treatment had no effect in C57BL/6J mice. This study provides comparative findings, as two phylogenetically related species showed differences in behavioral responses."

Previous work revealed that mice with a global or cell-specific knockout of βarr2 have altered responses to certain drugs; however, the effects of βarr2 on the excitability of medium spiny neurons (MSNs), and its role in mediating the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse are unknown. D1-Cre and D2-Cre transgenic mice were crossed with floxed βarr2 mice to eliminate βarr2 specifically in cells containing either D1 (D1<sup>βarr2-KO</sup> ) or D2 (D2<sup>βarr2-KO</sup> ) receptors. We used slice electrophysiology to characterize the role of βarr2 in modulating D1 and D2 nucleus accumbens MSN intrinsic excitability in response to DA and tested the locomotor-activating and rewarding effects of cocaine and morphine in these mice. Eliminating βarr2 attenuated the ability of DA to inhibit D2-MSNs and altered the DA-induced maximum firing rate in D1-MSNs. While D1<sup>βarr2-KO</sup> mice had mostly normal drug responses, D2<sup>βarr2-KO</sup> mice showed dose-dependent reductions in acute locomotor responses to cocaine and morphine, attenuated locomotor sensitization to cocaine, and blunted cocaine reward measured with conditioned place preference.

Adult zebrafishes were tested in three experiments: validation of white compartment as aversive in IA; open field test; and effect of antidepressant (fluoxetine, imipramine) and anxiolytic (diazepam, clonazepam). The data show the effectiveness of the white compartment as an aversive stimulus in IA. Antidepressant fluoxetine did not alter and imipramine impairs avoidance acquisition in higher doses. Imipramine also produced a sedative effect in lower doses. Anxiolytic and stimulant drugs facilitated learning at doses which did not impair locomotion, suggesting that pharmacological manipulation of other factors in addition to fear/anxiety can impact aversive learning in zebrafish."

Previous studies have shown that α6β2* nAChRs are abundantly expressed in midbrain dopaminergic neurons and play an important role in mediating the mechanism of nicotine and other drugs reward effect. It provided important targets for the development of anti-addiction drugs. The present study evaluated the pharmacological activity of TxIB in vivo with conditioned place preference (CPP) model, which were induced by subcutaneous injection (s.c.) of nicotine (NIC, 0.5 mg/kg). α-Conotoxin TxIB inhibited the expression and reinstatement of CPP in mice dose-dependently, but had no significant effect on locomotor activity. The concentrations of dopamine (DA), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and noradrenaline (NE) in different brain regions were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that TxIB could inhibit the concentrations of DA, GABA and NE in different brain regions (such as nucleus accumbens (NAc), hippocampus (HIP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC)) in NIC-induced mice. The concentrations of DA and NE were decreased in ventral tegmental area (VTA), while GABA had little change. The current work described the inhibition activity of TxIB in NIC-induced CPP, suggesting that α6β2* nAChR-targeted compound may be a promising drug for nicotine addiction treatment."

The effect of TA on the neuronal background underlying feeding activity was also analysed. (2) TA affected the spontaneous locomotion and of juvenile snails in a concentration-dependent way. Low (10 μM) TA concentration resulted in an increased (sliding or swimming) activity compared to the control; meanwhile, high (100 μM) TA concentration inhibited the locomotion of the animals. (3) Low (10 μM) TA concentration increased the frequency of sucrose-evoked feeding of intact animals, whereas high (100 μM) TA concentration resulted in significantly longer feeding latency and decreased feeding rate. The feeding changes proved to be partially irreversible, since after 48 h maintained in clear water, the animals tested in 100 μM TA previously still showed lower feeding rate in sucrose.

(5) On isolated CNS preparation, 100 μM TA applied in the bathing solution, however, failed to inhibit the activation of the central feeding (CPG) interneurons following application of extracellular dopamine. Our results suggest that TA affects both afferent and efferent peripheral functions in Lymnaea. TA reduces feeding activity by primarily blocking feeding sensory pathways, and its negative effect on locomotion may imply sensory pathways and/or ciliary activity."

Diagnosis of DDD allows prompt corrective actions but it is challenging due to the absence of any symptoms at early stages. In studying disc degeneration, measurement of the range of motion (RoM) and loads acting on the spine are crucial factors. However, direct measurement of RoM involves increased instrumentation and risk. In this paper, an innovative method is proposed for calculating RoM, emphasizing repeatability and reliability by considering the posterior thickness of the spine. This is achieved by offsetting the position of markers in relation to the actual vertebral loci. Three geometrically identical finite element models of L3-L4 are developed from a CT scan with different types of elements, and thereafter, mesh element-related metrics are provided for the assessment of the quality of models. The model with the best mesh quality is used for further analysis, where RoM are within ranges as reported in literature and in vivo experiment results. Various kinds of stresses acting on individual components including facet joints are analysed for normal and abnormal loading conditions. The results showed that the stresses in abnormal load conditions for all components including cortical (76.67 MPa), cancellous (69.18 MPa), annulus (6.30 MPa) and nucleus (0.343 MPa) are significantly greater as compared to normal loads (49.96 MPa, 44.2 MPa, 4.28 MPa and 0.23 MPa respectively). However, stress levels for both conditions are within safe limits (167-215 MPa for cortical, 46 MPa for the annulus and 3 MPa for facets). The results obtained could be used as a baseline motion and stresses of healthy subjects based on their respective lifestyles, which could benefit clinicians to suggest corrective actions for those affected by DDD."

In recent years, with in-depth research on ATPS fixation related to anatomy, biomechanical tests, and clinical applications, its firm stability and excellent biomechanical properties have been recognized by more and more surgeons. Although ATPS fixation has been gradually applied in clinic settings under the promotion of emerging distinctive instruments, its long-term efficacy still needs to be further clarified due to the lack of large sample size studies and long-term follow-up. Nevertheless, it is believed that with the maturity of digital devices and the development of precision medicine, ATPS fixation has a promising prospect."

Up to author's knowledge there is no study except this one, to reproduce in-vivo real measurements and intraoperative conditions during BAVD maneuver. The objective of this study was to evaluate the torsional strength of the instrumented thoracic spine under axial rotation moment as well as to define safety limits under BAVD corrective maneuver in scoliosis surgery. 10 fresh, full-length, young and intact human cadavers were tested. After proper assembly of the apparatus, the torque was applied through its apical part, simulating thoracic curve derotation. During each experiment the torque magnitude and angular range of derotation were evaluated. For more accurate analysis after every experiment the examined section of the spine was resected from the cadaver and evaluated morphologically and with a CT scan. The average torque to failure during BAVD simulation was 73,3 ± 5,49Nm. The average angle of BAVD to failure was 44,5 ± 8,16°. The majority of failures were in apical area. There was no significant difference between the fracture occurrence of left or right side of lateral wall of the pedicle. There was no spinal canal breach and/or medial wall failure in any specimen. The safety limits of thoracic spine and efficacy of BAVD for axial plane correction in the treatment of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) were established. It provided qualitative and quantitative information essential for the spinal derotation under safe loading limits."

Mechanical testing was done on segments from ileum and colon in 25 IBS rats and 13 Control rats. Morphometric data were obtained from digitized images of the segments at no-load and zero-stress states. Pressure and diameter changes were measured during flow and ramp distensions under active and passive experimental conditions. Circumferential stresses (force per area) and strains (deformation) were computed with referenced to the zero-stress state. The contraction frequency was analyzed. Contraction thresholds and maximum contraction amplitude were calculated in terms of mechanical stress and strain. Compared with controls, the IBS rats had lower body weight (P < 0.01), smaller colonic opening angle (P < 0.05), higher colonic contraction frequency (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01) and lower contraction thresholds of pressure, stress and strain in both ileum and colon (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). The maximum contraction pressure, stress and strain did not differ between IBS and Control groups (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the pressure, stress, and strain to evoke contractility in ileum and colon were lower whereas the frequency of induced colon contractions was higher in NMD IBS rats compared to normal rats. Furthermore, zero-stress state remodeling occur in colon in NMD IBS rats. Further studies on the association between intestinal biomechanical properties, hypersensitivity and afferent signaling in the IBS animal models are warranted."

Former studies have repeatedly demonstrated radiolucent lines behind the ventral and dorsal anchoring shields of the femoral components, which has led us to investigate this matter further. Therefore, three different cementing techniques were tested in a group of nine Sawbone samples each. These differed in the amount of cement applied on the femoral component as well as in the pressure application. Computed tomography was performed to evaluate and classify the cement penetration into the bone adjacent to the prosthesis according to the zones defined by the Knee Society scoring system. The results show significantly deeper cement penetration in all zones when a pressurizer is used. In the other two groups, no significant difference in the dorsal bevel cement penetration was noted. Additionally, no difference in ventral and dorsal cement penetrations (Zones 1 and 4) was delineated. In contrast, there was a significant difference in both the ventral bevel (Zone 2) as well as the distal anchoring surface (Zones 5-7). The use of a pressurizer results in greater cement penetration into all anchoring areas. Completely covering the component back surface results in a significantly higher penetration, which is mainly due to differences in volume. These data show significantly improved cementation results when using a pressurizer. Whether this improves the biomechanical properties and ultimately the revision rate requires further investigation."

Emerging data suggest that markedly increasing the intensity and variability of stepping practice may also be critical, although such strategies are discouraged during traditional rehabilitation. The goal of this study was to determine the individual and combined contributions of intensity and variability of stepping practice to improving walking speed and distance in individuals poststroke. Methods- This phase 2, randomized, blinded assessor clinical trial was performed between May 2015 and November 2018. Individuals between 18 and 85 years old with hemiparesis poststroke of >6 months duration were recruited. Of the 152 individuals screened, 97 were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 training groups, with 90 completing >10 sessions. Interventions consisted of either high-intensity stepping (70%-80% heart rate reserve) of variable, difficult stepping tasks (high variable), high-intensity stepping performing only forward walking (high forward), and low-intensity stepping in variable contexts at 30% to 40% heart rate reserve (low variable). Participants received up to 30 sessions over 2 months, with testing at baseline, post-training, and a 3-month follow-up. Primary outcomes included walking speeds and timed distance, with secondary measures of dynamic balance, transfers, spatiotemporal kinematics, and metabolic measures. Results- All walking gains were significantly greater following either high-intensity group versus low-variable training (all P<0.001) with significant correlations with stepping amount and rate (r=0.48-60; P<0.01). Additional gains in spatiotemporal symmetry were observed with high-intensity training, and balance confidence increased only following high-variable training in individuals with severe impairments. Conclusions- High-intensity stepping training resulted in greater improvements in walking ability and gait symmetry than low-intensity training in individuals with chronic stroke, with potential greater improvements in balance confidence.

Early stimulation is a standardized and straightforward technique to support children with developmental delays (aged 0-3 years) in reaching basic motor skills, which are essential for the execution of everyday activities, such as playing, feeding and locomotion. In doing so, early stimulation reduces the chances of permanent motor impairment, thus allowing the child to live a more functional life. However, outcomes of this treatment depend heavily on the involvement of the family, who are required to continue the early stimulation activities at home on a daily basis. To empower and educate families to administer standardized early stimulation programs at home, we developed an electronic early stimulation program, which provides personalized guidance to parents to administer early stimulation; together with evidence-based clinical decision support to therapists in tailoring ESP to observed needs."

This effect is the greatest when exercise intensity is high and exercise is administered immediately after motor practice (i.e., early in consolidation). Whether exercise can affect other motor learning types (e.g., sensorimotor adaptation) and tasks (e.g., walking) is still unclear as previous studies have not optimally refined the exercise parameters and long-term retention testing. Therefore, we investigated whether a single high-intensity exercise bout during early consolidation would improve the long-term retention and relearning of sensorimotor adaptation during split-belt treadmill walking. Twenty-six neurologically intact adults attended three sessions; sessions 2 and 3 were 1 day and 7 days after session 1, respectively. Participants were allocated either to Rest (REST) or to Exercise (EXE) group. In session 1, all groups walked on a split-belt treadmill in a 2:1 speed ratio (1.5:0.75 m/s). Then, half of the participants exercised for 5 min (EXE), while the other half rested for 5 min (REST). A short exercise bout during early consolidation did not improve retention or relearning of locomotor memories one or seven days after session 1. This result reinforces previous findings that the effect of exercise on motor learning may differ between sensorimotor locomotor adaptation and skilled-based upper extremity tasks; thus, the utility of exercise as a behavioral booster of motor learning may depend on the type of motor learning and task."

However, none of these legged robots can deal with difficult environments that include water, such as small lakes, streams, rain, mud, flooded terrain, etc. In this paper, we present for the first time a kinematic analysis and a hydrodynamic model of dog paddling motion in a robotic system. The quadrupedal paddling gait of dogs was first analyzed based on underwater video recording. Hydrodynamic drag force analysis in a paddling gait cycle was conducted for a prototype robotic dog. The prototype robotic dog was developed using four pre-charged pneumatics soft actuators with consideration of relative positions of CG (center of gravity) and CB (center of buoyancy) and their dynamic variation in paddling. It was found that such soft actuators have great potential in developing amphibious legged robots, because they are inherently water-tight, anti-rusty, simple in structural design, and have large hydrodynamic advantage due to their mostly hemi-cylindrical shape design. Trotting and paddling of the prototype robotic dog was also demonstrated. It is believed that our findings reported in this research will provide useful guidance in future development of amphibious robotic dogs."

This paper presents such a robotic system that allows for two working modes, the robot-active mode and human-active mode. The robot is designed to be equipped with magnetorheological (MR) actuators that have the advantages of high torque, fast response, flexible controllability, low power consumption and safety guarantee. The design and characteristics of the MR actuator are introduced. In the robot-active mode, the MR actuator works as a clutch to transfer the torque to the robotic joint safely. In the human-active mode, the MR actuator functions as a brake to provide resistance to help strengthen muscles. The working mode is determined by the human motion intention, which is detected via the skin surface electromyography (EMG) signals. The human-robot interaction torques are estimated using the EMG-driven impedance model. The biomechanical analysis based on AnyBody Modeling System (AMS) is used to help optimization. Then, an adaptive control method is proposed to realize the assist-as-needed (AAN) training strategy, where the robot can switch between these two modes. Experiments are conducted to validate the proposed design."
cross chest clips child restraints crash testing,SPORT/EXERCISE,19.6% SPORT/EXERCISE; 13.8% MODELING; 13.4% METHODS,"Bilston LE, Kent N, Brown J,",*Traffic injury prevention*,* [Cross-chest clips in child restraints: A crash testing study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433676),Cross-chest clips in child restraints: A crash testing study.,"<b>Objective:</b> Cross-chest clips are widely used in North American child restraints but are less common in other countries, partially due to concerns over anterior neck contacts in frontal crashes. They have recently been reported to be associated with lower odds of injury in real-world crashes, but there is a paucity of crash test performance information. This study aimed to compare the dynamic performance of a small child occupant in frontal crash tests with and without cross-chest clips in place. <b>Methods:</b> Frontal sled tests at 49 km/h were conducted to compare 2 cross-chest clip designs to nonuse of a chest clip. Tests using a P3/4 anthropomorphic test device (ATD) to represent the smallest occupant in a forward-facing child restraint were conducted with the chest clips in the recommended position and also in an incorrect lower position and with and without additional harness slack present. <b>Results:</b> Though contacts were observed between the chest clips and the base of the ATD's neck, there was little difference observed in head excursion or ATD sensor loads in the presence of the chest clips. No detectable change in the neck forces or moments was detected at the time of the neck contacts. The position of the clips did not affect the results. Harness slack increased head excursion, as expected, but this effect did not differ between the tests with and without the clips. <b>Conclusions:</b> Cross-chest clips do not appear to greatly influence the dynamic performance of a forward-facing child restraint in a simulated frontal crash. Taken together with recent research suggesting a potential benefit in injury reduction from the clips in the real world, possibly due to maintaining the harness straps in place on a child's shoulders, it may be appropriate to re-evaluate safety standards that prevent their use."

However, these tools, in the context of pediatric head injury, have yet to be validated due to a paucity of pediatric head response data. The goal of this study is to investigate the response and injury tolerance of the pediatric head to impact. Twelve pediatric heads were impacted in a series of drop tests. The heads were dropped onto five impact locations (forehead, occiput, vertex and right and left parietal) from drop heights of 15 and 30 cm. The head could freely fall without rotation onto a flat 19 mm thick platen. The impact force was measured using a 3-axis piezoelectric load cell attached to the platen. Age and drop height were found to be significant factors in the impact response of the pediatric head. The head acceleration (14%-15 cm; 103-30 cm), Head Injury Criterion (HIC) (253%-15 cm; 154%-30 cm) and impact stiffness (5800%-15 cm; 3755%-30 cm) when averaged across all impact locations increased with age from 33 weeks gestation to 16 years, while the pulse duration (66%-15 cm; 53%-30 cm) decreased with age. Increases in head acceleration, HIC and impact stiffness were also observed with increased drop height, while pulse duration decreased with increased drop height. One important observation was that three of the four cadaveric heads between the ages of 5-months and 22-months sustained fractures from the 15 cm and 30 cm drop heights. The 5-month-old sustained a right parietal linear fracture while the 11- and 22-month-old sustained diastatic linear fractures."

Here we address three topics that seem to be common points of confusion and misconception, with a specific focus on sports biomechanics applications: (1) joint reaction forces as they pertain to loads actually experienced by biological joints; (2) the partitioning of scalar quantities into directional components; and (3) weight and gravity alteration. For each topic, we discuss how mechanical concepts have been commonly misapplied in peer-reviewed publications, the consequences of those misapplications, and how biomechanics, exercise science, and other related disciplines can collectively benefit by more carefully adhering to and applying concepts of classical mechanics."

However, it has been not known whether and in what manner neuromuscular or biomechanical features of the fingers subserve the dexterity. We aimed to identify the features firstly differentiating the finger dexterity between trained and untrained individuals and secondly accounting for the individual differences in the dexterity across trained individuals. To this aim, two studies were conducted. The first study compared the finger dexterity and several neuromuscular and biomechanical characteristics of the fingers between pianists and non-musicians. As a measure of the dexterity, we used the maximum rate of repetitive finger movements. The results showed no differences in any biomechanical constraints of the fingers between the two groups (i.e. anatomical connectivity between the fingers and range of motion). However, the pianists exhibited faster finger movements and more independent control of movements between the fingers. These observations indicate expertise-dependent enhancement of the finger dexterity and reduction of neuromuscular constraints on movement independence between the fingers. The second study assessed individual differences in the finger dexterity between trained pianists. A penalized regression determined an association of the maximum movement speed of the fingers with both muscular strength and biomechanical characteristics of the fingers, but not with neuromuscular constraints of the fingers. None of these features covaried with measures of early and deliberate piano practice. These findings indicate that distinct biological factors of finger motor dexterity differentiate between the effects of piano practicing and individual differences across skilled pianists."

Data were collected for 47 healthy baseball pitchers throwing ten full-effort fastballs to the centre of the strike zone. For each pitch, 20 kinematic parameters were calculated with an automated motion capture system while pitch location was measured with a PITCHf/x system. Variability of each kinematic parameter was defined for each pitcher as the standard deviation among his fastballs thrown. For calculating consistency, each pitcher's mean pitch location was first calculated. The distances from each individual pitch to the mean pitch location were then found for each pitcher tested. A consistency metric was then calculated for each pitcher by averaging these distances. A multiple linear regression model was developed using stepwise regression with backwards elimination. The resulting model explained 58% of the variance in the consistency metric and included five parameters, three at foot contact (upper trunk tilt, shoulder abduction, and shoulder horizontal abduction) and two at time of maximum shoulder external rotation (shoulder external rotation and shoulder horizontal adduction). Reducing variability at the shoulder during the early portions of the pitching motion may improve consistency of ball location."

We sought to determine sex differences in head impact severity and frequency in youth ice hockey players. Male (n = 110) and female (n = 25) players (13-16 years old) were recruited from a local hockey organization. Players wore helmets instrumented with the Head Impact Telemetry System for all competitions and practices throughout the season. Seven team-seasons were captured. Random intercepts general mixed linear models determined whether linear acceleration and rotational acceleration differed by sex. Linear regression models evaluated the relationship between sex and impact frequency. All head impact biomechanics were natural log-transformed as their distributions were right-skewed. Females sustained fewer impacts per player than males (27 fewer impacts per player-season, p < 0.0001) even when analysis was limited to games only (21 fewer impacts per player-season, p < 0.0001). The linear acceleration was higher among females (1.07 g; 95% CI 1.00, 1.13; p = 0.04). There were no other meaningful sex differences in head impact severity. Female players are not permitted to body check, and this likely explains why they sustain fewer head impacts than males. However, as a result, females likely sustain a higher proportion of head impacts through illegal or unintentional head contact, and these impacts may result in more force being delivered to the head."

Kinematic testing parameters included varus/valgus stress, pronation/supination, and volar/dorsal translation at -10 degree, 0 degree, 15 degree, and 30 degree of metacarpophalangeal flexion. <b>Results:</b> Partial tear of the proper UCL did not result in significant increases in laxity in any direction compared with intact (<i>P</i> ≥ .132). Full tear of the proper UCL resulted in a significant increase in valgus angulation (18.8° ± 1.7° vs 11.5° ± 1.5°; <i>P</i> = .024) and pronation (15.4° ± 2.5° vs 12.6° ± 2.3°; <i>P</i> = .034) at 30 degree of flexion relative to intact. Complete tear of both the proper and accessory collateral ligaments resulted in increased valgus angulation at all degrees of flexion (<i>P</i> < .001). Complete tear also resulted in a significant volar translation at 0 degree, 15 degree, and 30 degree of flexion (<i>P</i> ≤ .016). <b>Conclusion:</b> Partial tear of the proper UCL does not significantly affect the stability of the joint, but full tear of the proper UCL increases valgus instability at 30 degree of flexion. Complete tear of the UCL is necessary for increased varus/valgus instability at all degrees of flexion and results in significant increases in pronation/supination and volar translation."

However, this procedure involves the risk of a higher complication rate. In order to reduce the occurrence of re-ruptures and pathological tendon extensions, a tendon reconstruction with the highest possible primary stability is desirable. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if augmentation using synthetic polyester tapes (QuadsTape™) could provide greater primary stability in case of different tendon suture techniques. 90 tendons of the superficial toe flexor of pigs were divided into 9 groups. The reconstruction method was combined using the factors suture technique (Kessler and Bunnell), augmentation (non-augmented and augmented with QuadsTape™) and defect type (end-to-end and 10 mm gap). The biomechanical measurements were performed on a material testing machine and consisted of a creep test, a cyclic test and a tear-off test. This study compared creep strain, ultimate load failure, maximum stress and stiffness. Irrespective of the type of defect involved, augmentation of the tendon sutures led to a significant increase of the maximum force (not augmented: 82.30 ± 25.48 N, augmented: 135.73 ± 30.69 N, p < 0.001) and the maximum stress (not augmented: 2.26 ± 0.83 MPa, augmented: 4.13 ± 1.79 MPa, p < 0.001). Furthermore, there was a non-significant increase in stiffness and no significant differences were observed with respect to creep strain. Augmentation of Achilles tendon reconstruction using QuadsTape™ increases composite strength and stiffness in the in vitro model, thus potentially contributing to the feasibility of early rehabilitation programs. Biological factors still need to be investigated in order to formulate appropriate indications."

In particular, the CSF pressure and composition within the optic nerve subarachnoid space (SAS) are key factors in diseases of the optic disc. ICP and intraocular pressure (IOP) establish a pressure gradient across the lamina cribrosa (LC). Alterations in this translaminar cribrosa pressure difference (TLPD) induce structural deformations in the LC manifested clinically by the appearance of optic disc edema (ODE) or optic disc cupping. Much has been learned about papilledema (i.e. ODE due to elevated ICP) from clinical observations and studies on patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Furthermore, optic nerve SAS hydrodynamics and TLPD are postulated to contribute to the pathogenesis of ODE observed in space flight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome.

Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), the primary risk factor for glaucoma, is thought to induce abnormally high strains in optic nerve head (ONH) tissues, which ultimately result in retinal ganglion cell damage and vision loss. The mechanisms by which excessive deformations result in vision loss remain incompletely understood. The ability of computational and in vitro models of the ONH to provide insight into these mechanisms, in many cases, depends on our ability to replicate the physiological environment, which in turn requires knowledge of tissue biomechanical properties. The majority of mechanical data published to date regarding the ONH has been obtained from tensile testing, yet compression has been shown to be the main mode of deformation in the ONH under elevated IOP. We have thus tested pig and rat ONH tissue using unconfined cyclic compression.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of various corneal incisions on pneumotonometer accuracy in enucleated porcine eyes. <b>Materials and Methods</b>: A pneumotonometer was used to measure IOP (IOPp) at manometrically controlled pressure levels of 10, 20, 30 and 40 mmHg in enucleated porcine eyes. IOP measurements at each level were repeated after one of the following corneal incisions: radial keratotomy (8 eyes), lamellar dissection (10 eyes), clear cornea standard phacoemulsification incisions (10 eyes). The pneumotonometer error, defined as the difference between IOPp and manometric pressure (IOPm), was calculated for each pressure level. The error before the corneal incisions was compared to the error after the corneal incisions to assess the accuracy of the pneumotonometer. <b>Results</b>: The pneumotonometer underestimates true IOP at all pressure levels, both before and after the corneal procedures. There was a statistically significant greater underestimation of IOP after radial keratotomy incisions at pressure levels of 20, 30 and 40 mmHg (<i>p</i> = .013, 0.004, and 0.002, respectively).

Sheep periosteum was collected and decellularized by a modified decellularization protocol. The effectiveness of cell removal was proved by HE and DAPI staining, DNA quantitative test, and agarose gel electrophoresis. After decellularization, its microstructure was found to become more porous while the integrality of collagen fibers remained undamaged, and the contents of collagen and glycosaminoglycan were not decreased significantly. Biomechanical analysis showed that the elastic modulus was significantly declined, while the yield stress was not affected, probably due to the collagen integrality. In vitro study of CCK-8 assay demonstrated that the acellular periosteum not only had no toxic effect to the MC3T3-E1 cells, but benefited the cell proliferation to some degree. In vivo experiment of guided bone regeneration was performed using a rabbit cranial model. Micro-CT and histological results revealed that the acellular periosteum not only effectively prevented the ingrowth of fibrous connective tissues, but also potentially facilitated bone regeneration. In conclusion, acellular sheep periostea, with wider sources, less costs, and more convenient fabrication process, would have great potential in the employment for guided bone regeneration.

The mechanical behaviour of living matter is governed not only by an elastic or viscoelastic response to loading on short time scales up to several minutes, but also by often crucial growth and remodelling responses on time scales from hours to months. Phenomena of growth and remodelling play important roles, for example during morphogenesis in early life as well as in homeostasis and pathogenesis in adult tissues, which often adapt to changes in their chemo-mechanical environment as a result of ageing, diseases, injury or surgical intervention. Mechano-regulated growth and remodelling are observed in various soft tissues, ranging from tendons and arteries to the eye and brain, but also in bone, lower organisms and plants. Understanding and predicting growth and remodelling of living systems is one of the most important challenges in biomechanics and mechanobiology. This article reviews the current state of growth and remodelling as it applies primarily to soft tissues, and provides a perspective on critical challenges and future directions."

Limb force increases with speed but direct measures of limb ground reaction forces (GRFs) at gallop are sparse. This study reports GRFs for multiple limbs, using force plates, across seven Thoroughbred racehorses during ridden galloping. The results show peak vertical GRF values of 13.6 N kg<sup>-1</sup> (non-lead hindlimb), 12.3 N kg<sup>-1</sup> (lead hindlimb), 14.0 N kg<sup>-1</sup> (non-lead forelimb) and 13.6 N kg<sup>-1</sup> (lead forelimb) at 11.4 m s<sup>-1</sup> and recorded values are consistent with those predicted from duty factor. The distribution of body weight between the forelimbs and hindlimbs is approximated to 50:50, and is variable with speed, unlike the 60:40 commonly stated for cursorial quadrupeds in the literature. An even distribution of load on all limbs may help minimise accumulation of fatigue and assist in injury avoidance. Cranio-caudal force data concur with the observation that horses apply a net accelerative impulse with the hindlimbs and a net decelerative impulse with the forelimbs. Capturing GRFs enhances our knowledge on the mechanics of galloping in fast-moving species and provides insight into injury risk and factors limiting athletic performance."
