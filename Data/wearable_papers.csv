Progressive gait dysfunction is one of the primary motor symptoms in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). It is generally expressed as reduced step length and gait speed and as increased variability in step time and step length. People with PD also exhibit stooped posture which disrupts gait and impedes social interaction. The gait and posture impairments are usually resistant to the pharmacological treatment, worsen as the disease progresses, increase the likelihood of falls, and result in higher rates of hospitalization and mortality. These impairments may be caused by perceptual deficiencies (poor spatial awareness and loss of temporal rhythmicity) due to the disruptions in processing intrinsic information related to movement initiation and execution which can result in misperceptions of the actual effort required to perform a desired movement and maintain a stable posture. Consequently, people with PD often depend on external cues during execution of motor tasks. Numerous studies involving open-loop cues have shown improvements in gait and freezing of gait (FoG) in people with PD. However, the benefits of cueing may be limited, since cues are provided in a consistent/rhythmic manner irrespective of how well a person follows them. This limitation can be addressed by providing feedback in real-time to the user about performance (closed-loop cueing) which may help to improve movement patterns. Some studies that used closed-loop cueing observed improvements in gait and posture in PD, but the treadmill-based setup in a laboratory would not be accessible outside of a research setting, and the skills learned may not readily and completely transfer to overground locomotion in the community. Technologies suitable for cueing outside of laboratory environments could facilitate movement practice during daily activities at home or in the community and could strongly reinforce movement patterns and improve clinical outcomes. This narrative review presents an overview of cueing paradigms that have been utilized to improve gait and posture in people with PD and recommends development of closed-loop wearable systems that can be used at home or in the community to improve gait and posture in PD."

Experimental work in the laboratory has used either human cadavers or volunteers. Cadavers can be instrumented with high-grade sensors that are tightly coupled to the skull for accurate measurements, but they cannot exhibit a functional response to determine a threshold for brain injury. Volunteers can also be instrumented with high-grade sensors in controlled laboratory experiments, but any head accelerations they experience must be well below an injurious level.

The model incorporates a two-dimensional kinematic description in the sagittal plane for the calculation of muscle lever arms and torques. To reduce estimation errors due to model uncertainties, a filtering algorithm is necessary that employs segmental orientation sensor measurements. Because of the model's inherent nonlinearities and nonsmooth dynamics, a square-root cubature Kalman filter was developed. The performance of the novel estimation approach was evaluated in silico and in an experimental procedure. The experimental study was conducted with body-worn sensors and a test-bench that was specifically designed to obtain reference angle and torque measurements for a single joint. Results show that the filter is able to reconstruct joint angle positions, velocities and torque, as well as, joint stiffness during experimental test bench movements."

Compared with the previous works, the KT-TENG without a macro-scale air gap inside, or stretchable triboelectric layers, possesses various advantages, such as simple fabrication, compact structure, superior flexibility and stability, excellent conformable contact with skin, and wide-range selection of triboelectric materials. This work provides a new prospect for a wearable, self-powered, active human motion sensor and has numerous potential applications in the fields of healthcare monitoring, human-machine interfacing, and prosthesis developing."

The generalized energy budget for fish (i.e., Energy Consumed=Metabolism+Waste+Growth) is as relevant today as when it was first proposed decades ago and serves as a foundational concept in fish biology. Yet, generating accurate measurements of components of the bioenergetics equation in wild fish is a major challenge. How often does a fish eat and what does it consume? How much energy is expended on locomotion? How do human-induced stressors influence energy acquisition and expenditure? Generating answers to these questions is important to fisheries management and to our understanding of adaptation and evolutionary processes. The advent of electronic tags (transmitters and data loggers) has provided biologists with improved opportunities to understand bioenergetics in wild fish. Here, we review the growing diversity of electronic tags with a focus on sensor-equipped devices that are commercially available (e.g., heart rate/electrocardiogram, electromyogram, acceleration, image capture). Next, we discuss each component of the bioenergetics model, recognizing that most research to date has focused on quantifying the activity component of metabolism, and identify ways in which the other, less studied components (e.g., consumption, specific dynamic action component of metabolism, somatic growth, reproductive investment, waste) could be estimated remotely. We conclude with a critical but forward-looking appraisal of the opportunities and challenges in using existing and emerging electronic sensor-tags for the study of fish energetics in the wild. Electronic tagging has become a central and widespread tool in fish ecology and fisheries management; the growing and increasingly affordable toolbox of sensor tags will ensure this trend continues, which will lead to major advances in our understanding of fish biology over the coming decades."

Human body motion analysis based on wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) receives a lot of attention from both the research community and the and industrial community. This is due to the significant role in, for instance, mobile health systems, sports and human computer interaction. In sensor based activity recognition, one of the major issues for obtaining reliable results is the sensor placement/assignment on the body. For inertial motion capture (joint kinematics estimation) and analysis, the IMU-to-segment (I2S) assignment and alignment are central issues to obtain biomechanical joint angles. Existing approaches for I2S assignment usually rely on hand crafted features and shallow classification approaches (e.g., support vector machines), with no agreement regarding the most suitable features for the assignment task. Moreover, estimating the complete orientation alignment of an IMU relative to the segment it is attached to using a machine learning approach has not been shown in literature so far. This is likely due to the high amount of training data that have to be recorded to suitably represent possible IMU alignment variations. In this work, we propose online approaches for solving the assignment and alignment tasks for an arbitrary amount of IMUs with respect to a biomechanical lower body model using a deep learning architecture and windows of 128 gyroscope and accelerometer data samples. For this, we combine convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for local filter learning with long-short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent networks as well as generalized recurrent units (GRUs) for learning time dynamic features. The assignment task is casted as a classification problem, while the alignment task is casted as a regression problem. In this framework, we demonstrate the feasibility of augmenting a limited amount of real IMU training data with simulated alignment variations and IMU data for improving the recognition/estimation accuracies. With the proposed approaches and final models we achieved 98.57% average accuracy over all segments for the I2S assignment task (100% when excluding left/right switches) and an average median angle error over all segments and axes of 2 . 91 for the I2S alignment task."

Along with traditional metrics, such as cadence, speed, step length, and vertical oscillation, this system estimates ground contact time and ground reaction forces using machine learning techniques. This equipment is less expensive and cumbersome than the currently used alternatives: Optical tracking systems, in-shoe pressure measurement systems, and force plates. Another advantage, compared to existing methods, is that natural movement is not impeded at the expense of measurement accuracy. The proposed technology could be applied to different sports and activities, including walking, running, motion disorder diagnosis, and geriatric studies. In this paper, we present the results of tests in which the system performed real-time estimation of some parameters of walking and running which are relevant to biomechanical research. Contact time and ground reaction forces computed by the neural network were found to be as accurate as those obtained by an in-shoe pressure measurement system."

The cooperative filters use information from either all inertial sensors attached to the body, Matricial KF; or use information from the inertial sensors and the potentiometers of an exoskeleton, Markovian KF. A one minute walking trial of a subject walking with a 6-DoF exoskeleton was used to assess the absolute segment angle of the trunk, thigh, shank, and foot. The results indicate that regardless of the segment and filter applied, the more complex calibration always results in a significantly better performance compared to the simplified calibration.

Hammer-throw has a long-standing history in track and field, but unlike some other sports events, men's hammer throw has not seen a new world record since 1986. One of the possible reasons for this stagnation could be the lack of real-time biomechanical feedback training. In this study, we proposed to establish scientifically described training targets and routes, which in turn required tools that could measure and quantify characteristics of an effective hammer-throw. Towards this goal, we have developed a real-time biomechanical feedback device-a wireless sensor system-to help the training of hammer-throw. The system includes two sensors-an infrared proximity sensor for tracing the hip vertical movement and a load cell for recording the wire tension during a hammer-throw. The system uses XBees for data transmission and an Arduino processor for data processing and system control. The results revealed that the wire tension measurement could supply sufficient key features for coaches to analyze hammer-throw and give real-time feedback for improving training efficiency. "

Plants are able to sense and respond to minute tilt from the vertical direction of the gravity, which is key to maintain their upright posture during development. However, gravisensing in plants relies on a peculiar sensor made of microsize starch-filled grains (statoliths) that sediment and form tiny granular piles at the bottom of the cell. How such a sensor can detect inclination is unclear, as granular materials like sand are known to display flow threshold and finite avalanche angle due to friction and interparticle jamming. Here, we address this issue by combining direct visualization of statolith avalanches in plant cells and experiments in biomimetic cells made of microfluidic cavities filled with a suspension of heavy Brownian particles. We show that, despite their granular nature, statoliths move and respond to the weakest angle, as a liquid clinometer would do. Comparison between the biological and biomimetic systems reveals that this liquid-like behavior comes from the cell activity, which agitates statoliths with an apparent temperature one order of magnitude larger than actual temperature. Our results shed light on the key role of active fluctuations of statoliths for explaining the remarkable sensitivity of plants to inclination.

A series of sled tests were performed on 10 healthy volunteers at three severity levels to simulate low-severity frontal impacts. Electrical activity-electromyography (EMG)-and muscle mechanical tension was measured bilaterally on the upper trapezius. A novel mechanical contraction (MC) sensor was used to measure the tension on the muscle surface. The neck extensor loads were estimated based on the inverse dynamics approach. The results showed strong linear correlation (Pearson's coefficient = 0.821) between the estimated neck muscle load and the muscle tension measured with the MC sensor. The peak of the estimated neck muscle force delayed 0.2 ± 30.6 ms on average vs. the peak MC sensor signal compared to the average delay of 61.8 ± 37.4 ms vs. the peak EMG signal. The observed differences in EMG and MC sensor collected signals indicate that the MC sensor offers an additional insight into the analysis of the neck muscle load and activity in impact conditions. This approach enables a more detailed assessment of the muscle-tendon complex load of a vehicle occupant in pre-impact and impact conditions.

Sensory impairments decrease quality of life and can slow or hinder rehabilitation. Small, computationally powerful electronics have enabled the recent development of wearable systems aimed to improve function for individuals with sensory impairments. The purpose of this review is to synthesize current haptic wearable research for clinical applications involving sensory impairments. We define haptic wearables as untethered, ungrounded body worn devices that interact with skin directly or through clothing and can be used in natural environments outside a laboratory. Results of this review are categorized by degree of sensory impairment. Total impairment, such as in an amputee, blind, or deaf individual, involves haptics acting as sensory replacement; partial impairment, as is common in rehabilitation, involves haptics as sensory augmentation; and no impairment involves haptics as trainer. This review found that wearable haptic devices improved function for a variety of clinical applications including: rehabilitation, prosthetics, vestibular loss, osteoarthritis, vision loss and hearing loss. Future haptic wearables development should focus on clinical needs, intuitive and multimodal haptic displays, low energy demands, and biomechanical compliance for long-term usage. "

The design of multiple human activity recognition applications in areas such as healthcare, sports and safety relies on wearable sensor technologies. However, when making decisions based on the data acquired by such sensors in practical situations, several factors related to sensor data alignment, data losses, and noise, among other experimental constraints, deteriorate data quality and model accuracy. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a data-driven iterative learning framework to classify human locomotion activities such as walk, stand, lie, and sit, extracted from the Opportunity dataset. Data acquired by twelve 3-axial acceleration sensors and seven inertial measurement units are initially de-noised using a two-stage consecutive filtering approach combining a band-pass Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and a wavelet filter. A series of statistical parameters are extracted from the kinematical features, including the principal components and singular value decomposition of roll, pitch, yaw and the norm of the axial components. The novel interactive learning procedure is then applied in order to minimize the number of samples required to classify human locomotion activities. Only those samples that are most distant from the centroids of data clusters, according to a measure presented in the paper, are selected as candidates for the training dataset. The newly built dataset is then used to train an SVM multi-class classifier. The latter will produce the lowest prediction error. The proposed learning framework ensures a high level of robustness to variations in the quality of input data, while only using a much lower number of training samples and therefore a much shorter training time, which is an important consideration given the large size of the dataset."

Motivation Glaucoma is currently the most common irreversible cause of blindness worldwide. A significant risk factor is an individually increased intraocular pressure (IOP). A precise measurement method is needed to determine the IOP in order to support the diagnosis of the disease and to monitor the outcome of the IOP reduction as a medical intervention. A handheld device is under development with which the patient can perform self-measurements outside the clinical environment. Method For the measurement principle of the self-tonometer the eye is acoustically excited to oscillate, which is analyzed and attributed to the present IOP. In order to detect the corneal oscillation, an optical sensor is required which meets the demands of a compact, battery driven self-tonometer. A combination of an infrared diode and a phototransistor provides a high-resolution measurement of the corneal oscillation in the range of 10 μm-150 μm, which is compared to a reference sensor in the context of this study. By means of an angular arrangement of the emitter and the detector, the degree of reflected radiation of the cornea can be increased, allowing a measurement with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Results By adjusting the angle of incidence between the detector and the emitter, the signal-to-noise ratio was improved by 40 dB which now allows reasonable measurements of the corneal oscillation. For low amplitudes (10 μm) the signal-to-noise ratio is 10% higher than that of the commercial reference sensor. On the basis of amplitude variations at different IOP levels, the estimated standard uncertainty amounts to <0.5 mm Hg in the physiological pressure range with the proposed measuring approach. Conclusion With a compact and cost-effective approach, that suits the requirements for a handheld self-tonometer, the corneal oscillation can be detected with high temporal resolution. The cross-sensitivity of the sensor concept concerning a distance variation can be reduced by adding a distance sensor. Existing systematic influences of corneal biomechanics will be integrated in the sensor concept as a consecutive step."

Increasing interest in analyzing human gait using various wearable sensors, which is known as Human Activity Recognition (HAR), can be found in recent research. Sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes are widely used in HAR. Recently, high interest has been shown in the use of wearable sensors in numerous applications such as rehabilitation, computer games, animation, filmmaking, and biomechanics. In this paper, classification of human daily activities using Ensemble Methods based on data acquired from smartphone inertial sensors involving about 30 subjects with six different activities is discussed. The six daily activities are walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and lying. It involved three stages of activity recognition; namely, data signal processing (filtering and segmentation), feature extraction and classification. Five types of ensemble classifiers utilized are Bagging, Adaboost, Rotation forest, Ensembles of nested dichotomies (END) and Random subspace. These ensemble classifiers employed Support vector machine (SVM) and Random forest (RF) as the base learners of the ensemble classifiers. The data classification is evaluated with the holdout and 10-fold cross-validation evaluation methods. The performance of each human daily activity was measured in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. In addition, the performance is also measured based on the comparison of overall accuracy rate of classification between different ensemble classifiers and base learners. It was observed that overall, SVM produced better accuracy rate with 99.22% compared to RF with 97.91% based on a random subspace ensemble classifier."

In spite of having large height and body mass, horses are cursorial animals with an extensive gait repertoire and considerable athletic abilities. The limbs have evolved so that the heavy musculature is confined to the proximal limbs while the distal limbs are light in weight with a single functional digit and long, lightweight tendons to move and support the distal joints. These adaptations reduce the moment of inertia and decrease the energy expended to protract and retract the limbs during locomotion. There is a division of labor between the forelimbs, which have a pillar-like construction specialized for weight bearing, and the hind limbs, in which the more angulated joints provide leverage for the generation of propulsion. Each gait is characterized by a repeated, rhythmic pattern of limb movements with a single repetition of the pattern being a stride. Limb movements are coordinated by central pattern generators in the spinal cord that determine the rhythmic patterns of flexion and extension in the joints during the swing and stance phases. The patterns can be modified by commands descending from the motor cortex or in response to proprioceptive feedback that provides awareness of body and limb position and movements. Musculoskeletal pathologies are a common problem in equine athletes. Lame horses reduce the load-bearing responsibilities of the painful limb by adapting the movement pattern with the goal of transferring vertical force from the lame limb to the compensating limbs. When the horse is trotting, this is associated with asymmetrical movements of the poll, withers, and croup on the 2 diagonals. The lame limb can be identified, and the degree of lameness can be assessed qualitatively by visual assessment or quantitatively using an inertial sensor system."

As an interface between the blood flow and vessel wall, endothelial cells (ECs) are exposed to hemodynamic forces, and the biochemical molecules released from ECs-blood flow interaction are important determinants of vascular homeostasis. Versatile microfluidic chips have been designed to simulate the biological and physiological parameters of the human vascular system, but in situ and real-time monitoring of the mechanical force-triggered signals during vascular mechanotransduction still remains a significant challenge. Here, such challenge is fulfilled for the first time, by preparation of a flexible and stretchable electrochemical sensor and its incorporation into a microfluidic vascular chip. This allows simulating of in vivo physiological and biomechanical parameters of blood vessels, and simultaneously monitoring the mechanically induced biochemical signals in real time. Specifically, the cyclic circumferential stretch that is actually exerted on endothelium but is hard to reproduce in vitro is successfully recapitulated, and nitric oxide signals under normal blood pressure, as well as reactive oxygen species signals under hypertensive states, are well documented.

Prior work that used simple and easy-to-learn algorithms based on a singular feature and rule-based classifiers are not sufficient to learn variations in patient walking styles and freezing patterns. Efforts to use machine-learning algorithms suffer from challenges caused by imbalanced datasets. Here, we propose a new approach for FoG detection using a wide set of online calculable features and an instance-based and non-parametric Possibilistic K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) classifier. The issue of imbalanced datasets is addressed using the Self-Organizing-Map (SOM) algorithm."

In recent years, wearable exoskeletons and powered prosthetics have been considered key elements to remedy mobility loss. One of the main challenges pertaining to this field is the prediction of the wearer's desired motion. In this paper, we perform a human locomotion analysis, and we investigate the accuracy of predicting the angular position of the lower limb joints from the motion of walking canes. Nine healthy subjects took part of this study and performed a locomotor task that comprised straight walking on flat ground, stair ascent, and upright resting posture. Recurrent Neural Networks and polynomial fitting using Least Squares were used to model dynamic and static non-linear mappings, respectively, between the motion of a cane and its contra-lateral leg joints. A successful prediction of both the hip and knee joints was achieved using information from the cane only, and significant improvement of the prediction error was realized through the addition of data from the arm joints. Overall, Recurrent Neural Networks outperformed Least Squares for both joints' angular position prediction. When using the cane only, the static maps were able to predict steady behaviour but failed in predicting transitioning, as opposed to RNN, which was able to capture both steady behaviour and transitions."

Wearable sensors provide an opportunity to collect a variety of additional variables during clinical tests. The purpose of this study was to assess a new wearable inertial sensor system (iTUG) by investigating the effects of cognitive tasks in a dual-task paradigm on spatiotemporal and kinematic variables during the TUG. No previous studies have looked at both spatiotemporal variables and kinematics during dual-task TUG tests. 20 healthy young participants (10 males) performed a total 15 TUG trials with two different cognitive tasks and a normal control condition. Total time, along with spatiotemporal gait parameters and kinematics for all TUG subtasks (sit-to-stand, walking, turn, turn-to-sit), were measured using the inertial sensors. Time-to-completion from iTUG was highly correlated with concurrent manual timing. Spatiotemporal variables during walking showed expected differences between control and cognitive dual-tasks while trunk kinematics appeared to show more sensitivity to dual-tasks than reported previously in straight line walking. Non-walking TUG subtasks showed only minor changes during dual-task conditions indicating a possible attentional shift away from the cognitive task. Stride length and some variability measures were significantly different between the two cognitive tasks suggesting an ability to discriminate between tasks. Overall, the use of the iTUG system allows the collection of both traditional and potentially more discriminatory variables with a protocol that is easily used in a clinical setting. "

The purpose of the present study was to compare the hallux valgus deformity pressure parameters seen in standard footwear (no orthosis) versus the pressure observed in the same footwear with the addition of 3 different length orthoses. The forefoot pressure at a hallux valgus deformity was recorded with pressure sensors placed on the plantar, medial, and dorsal surface of the first metatarsal head. The participants performed walking trials without an orthosis and with orthoses of 3 different lengths. The average pressure and maximum pressure of each area was recorded for each orthosis, and comparisons were made across the groups. The plantar pressures were decreased in the full length and 3/4 length orthoses, and the dorsal pressures were increased with the use of the full-length and sulcus-length orthoses. Significant changes in medial pressure were not seen with the addition of any orthosis compared with standard footwear alone. However, a trend toward increased medial pressures was seen with the full- and sulcus-length orthoses, and the 3/4-length orthoses exhibited a trend toward decreased medial pressures. We were unable to demonstrate that the use of a custom foot orthosis significantly decreases the medial pressures on the first metatarsal head in patients with hallux valgus deformity.

The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of outdoor running fatigue and MTSS on both dynamic loading and dynamic stability derived from trunk and tibial accelerometery. Runners with (n=14) and without (n=16) history of MTSS performed an outdoor fatigue run of 3200m. Accelerometer-based measures averaged per lap included dynamic loading of the trunk and tibia (i.e. axial peak positive acceleration, signal power magnitude, and shock attenuation) as well as dynamic trunk stability (i.e. tri-axial root mean square ratio, step and stride regularity, and sample entropy). Regression coefficients from generalised estimating equations were used to evaluate group by fatigue interactions.

Specifically, in MTSS only, decreases mediolateral sample entropy i.e. loss of complexity was associated with running fatigue (p<0.01).

This work focuses on the proof-mass mechanical structural design improvement of a tri-axial piezoresistive accelerometer specifically designed for head injuries monitoring where medium-G impacts are common; for example, in sports such as racing cars or American Football. The device requires the highest sensitivity achievable with a single proof-mass approach, and a very low error (<1%) as the accuracy for these types of applications is paramount. The optimization method differs from previous work as it is based on the progressive increment of the sensor proof-mass mass moment of inertia (MMI) in all three axes. Three different designs are presented in this study, where at each step of design evolution, the MMI of the sensor proof-mass gradually increases in all axes. The work numerically demonstrates that an increment of MMI determines an increment of device sensitivity with a simultaneous reduction of cross-axis sensitivity in the particular axis under study. This is due to the linkage between the external applied stress and the distribution of mass (of the proof-mass), and therefore of its mass moment of inertia. Progressively concentrating the mass on the axes where the piezoresistors are located (i.e., <i>x</i>- and <i>y</i>-axis) by increasing the MMI in the <i>x</i>- and <i>y</i>-axis, will undoubtedly increase the longitudinal stresses applied in that areas for a given external acceleration, therefore increasing the piezoresistors fractional resistance change and eventually positively affecting the sensor sensitivity. The final device shows a sensitivity increase of about 80% in the <i>z</i>-axis and a reduction of cross-axis sensitivity of 18% respect to state-of-art sensors available in the literature from a previous work of the authors. Sensor design, modelling, and optimization are presented, concluding the work with results, discussion, and conclusion."

External forces, such as ground reaction force or air drag acting on athletes' bodies in sports, determine the sport-specific demands on athletes' physical fitness. In order to establish appropriate physical conditioning regimes, which adequately prepare athletes for the loads and physical demands occurring in their sports and help reduce the risk of injury, sport-and/or discipline-specific knowledge of the external forces is needed. However, due to methodological shortcomings in biomechanical research, data comprehensively describing the external forces that occur in alpine super-G (SG) and downhill (DH) are so far lacking. Therefore, this study applied new and accurate wearable sensor-based technology to determine the external forces acting on skiers during World Cup (WC) alpine skiing competitions in the disciplines of SG and DH and to compare these with those occurring in giant slalom (GS), for which previous research knowledge exists. External forces were determined using WC forerunners carrying a differential global navigation satellite system (dGNSS). Combining the dGNSS data with a digital terrain model of the snow surface and an air drag model, the magnitudes of ground reaction forces were computed. It was found that the applied methodology may not only be used to track physical demands and loads on athletes, but also to simultaneously investigate safety aspects, such as the effectiveness of speed control through increased air drag and ski-snow friction forces in the respective disciplines. Therefore, the component of the ground reaction force in the direction of travel (ski-snow friction) and air drag force were computed. This study showed that (1) the validity of high-end dGNSS systems allows meaningful investigations such as characterization of physical demands and effectiveness of safety measures in highly dynamic sports; (2) physical demands were substantially different between GS, SG, and DH; and (3) safety-related reduction of skiing speed might be most effectively achieved by increasing the ski-snow friction force in GS and SG. For DH an increase in the ski-snow friction force might be equally as effective as an increase in air drag force."

This study explored the use of body worn sensors to evaluate the vibrations that act on the human body in alpine ski racing from a general and a back overuse injury prevention perspective. In the course of a biomechanical field experiment, six male European Cup-level athletes each performed two runs on a typical giant slalom (GS) and slalom (SL) course, resulting in a total of 192 analyzed turns. Three-dimensional accelerations were measured by six inertial measurement units placed on the right and left shanks, right and left thighs, sacrum, and sternum. Based on these data, power spectral density (PSD; i.e., the signal's power distribution over frequency) was determined for all segments analyzed. Additionally, as a measure expressing the severity of vibration exposure, root-mean-square (RMS) acceleration acting on the lower back was calculated based on the inertial acceleration along the sacrum's longitudinal axis. In both GS and SL skiing, the PSD values of the vibrations acting at the shank were found to be largest for frequencies below 30 Hz. While being transmitted through the body, these vibrations were successively attenuated by the knee and hip joint. At the lower back (i.e., sacrum sensor), PSD values were especially pronounced for frequencies between 4 and 10 Hz, whereas a corresponding comparison between GS and SL revealed higher PSD values and larger RMS values for GS. Because vibrations in this particular range (i.e., 4 to 10 Hz) include the spine's resonant frequency and are known to increase the risk of structural deteriorations/abnormalities of the spine, they may be considered potential components of mechanisms leading to overuse injuries of the back in alpine ski racing. Accordingly, any measure to control and/or reduce such skiing-related vibrations to a minimum should be recognized and applied. In this connection, wearable sensor technologies might help to better monitor and manage the overall back overuse-relevant vibration exposure of athletes in regular training and or competition settings in the near future."

Further design improvements are needed to prevent tissue accumulation in the housing recess associated with artificially high IMP measurements. These findings emphasize fundamental protective housing design elements crucial for achieving reliable IMP measurements."

There has been recent dramatic increase in the use of sensors affixed to the heads or helmets of athletes to measure the biomechanics of head impacts that lead to concussion. The relationship between injury and linear or rotational head acceleration measured by such sensors can be quantified with an injury risk curve. The utility of the injury risk curve relies on the accuracy of both the clinical diagnosis and the biomechanical measure. The focus of our analysis was to demonstrate the influence of three sources of error on the shape and interpretation of concussion injury risk curves: sampling variability associated with a rare event, concussion under-reporting, and sensor measurement error. We utilized Bayesian statistical methods to generate synthetic data from previously published concussion injury risk curves developed using data from helmet-based sensors on collegiate football players and assessed the effect of the three sources of error on the risk relationship. Accounting for sampling variability adds uncertainty or width to the injury risk curve. Assuming a variety of rates of unreported concussions in the non-concussed group, we found that accounting for under-reporting lowers the rotational acceleration required for a given concussion risk. Lastly, after accounting for sensor error, we find strengthened relationships between rotational acceleration and injury risk, further lowering the magnitude of rotational acceleration needed for a given risk of concussion. As more accurate sensors are designed and more sensitive and specific clinical diagnostic tools are introduced, our analysis provides guidance for the future development of comprehensive concussion risk curves.

This strategy could allow the development of advanced features for cardiovascular electronic devices, such as extended life, miniaturization to improve comfort and conformability, and functions that integrate with real-time data transmission, mobile data processing and smart power utilization. In this Review, we present an update on self-powered cardiovascular implantable electronic devices and wearable active sensors. We summarize the existing self-powered technologies and their fundamental features. We then review the current applications of self-powered electronic devices in the cardiovascular field, which have two main goals. The first is to harvest energy from the body as a sustainable power source for cardiovascular electronic devices, such as cardiac pacemakers. The second is to use self-powered devices with low power consumption and high performance as active sensors to monitor physiological signals (for example, for active endocardial monitoring). Finally, we present the current challenges and future perspectives for the field."

Using a wearable sensor, data were collected for cadence, braking, bounce, pelvic rotation, pelvic drop, and ground contact time for 27 runners. A composite index was calculated based on the ""typical"" data (4-14 km) for each runner and evaluated for 14 individual 2-km sections thereafter to detect ""atypical"" data (ie, higher indices). A cluster analysis assigned all runners to a subgroup based on similar trends in running alterations. Results indicated that the indices became significantly higher starting at 20 to 22 km. Cluster 1 exhibited lower indices than cluster 2 throughout the marathon, and the only significant difference in characteristics between clusters was that cluster 1 had a lower age-grade performance score than cluster 2.

The active pressure-sensing regions of the sensors have the shape of a segment of an annulus with a 150-deg circumferential span, and employ a polar/circumferential ""ring-and-spoke"" sensel grid layout. There are two sensor sizes, having outside radii of 44 and 48 mm, respectively. The new design was evaluated in human cadaver hip joints using two methods. The stress magnitudes and spatial distribution measured by the sensor were compared to contact stresses measured by pressure sensitive film during static loading conditions that simulated heel strike during walking and stair climbing. Additionally, the forces obtained by spatial integration of the sensor contact stresses were compared to the forces measured by load cells during the static simulations and for loading applied by a dynamic hip simulator. Stress magnitudes and spatial distribution patterns obtained from the sensor versus from pressure sensitive film exhibited good agreement. The joint forces obtained during both static and dynamic loading were within ±10% and ±26%, respectively, of the forces measured by the load cells.

Movement competence (MC) is defined as the development of sufficient skill to assure successful performance in different physical activities. Monitoring children MC during maturation is fundamental to detect early minor delays and define effective intervention. To this purpose, several MC assessment batteries are available. When evaluating movement strategies, with the aim of identifying specific skill components that may need improving, widespread MC assessment is limited by high time consumption for scoring and the need for trained operators to ensure reliability. This work aims to facilitate and support the assessment by designing, implementing and validating an instrumented version of the TGMD-2 locomotor subtest based on Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to quantify MC in children rapidly and objectively. 45 typically developing children, aged 6-10, performed the TGMD-2 locomotor subtest (six skills). During the tests, children wore five IMUs mounted on lower back, on ankles and on wrists. Sensor and video recordings of the tests were collected. Three expert evaluators performed the standard assessment of TGMD-2. Using theoretical and modelling approaches, algorithms were implemented to automatically score children tests based on IMUs' data. The automatic assessment, compared to the standard one, showed an agreement higher than 87% on average on the entire group for each skill and a reduction of time for scoring from 15 to 2min per participant. Results support the use of IMUs for MC assessment: this approach will allow improving the usability of MC assessment, supporting objectively evaluator decisions and reducing time requirement for the evaluation of large groups."

Our ability to stay upright in the face of obstacles, such as holes in the ground, is quite remarkable. However, we understand relatively little about how humans adjust limb mechanical behaviour to recover from unexpected perturbations. In this study, we determined how the joints of the lower-limb respond to recover from a rapid, unexpected drop in substrate height during human hopping. We recorded lower-limb kinematics and kinetics while subjects performed steady-state hopping at their preferred frequency on an elevated platform (5, 10 and 20 cm). At an unknown time, we elicited an unexpected perturbation (i.e. a hole in the ground) via the rapid removal of the platform.

Our results suggest that humans successfully recover from falling in a hole by increasing the energy absorbed predominantly in distal lower-limb joints (i.e. the ankle) across perturbation heights ranging from 5 to 10 cm. However, with increased perturbation height (20 cm) humans increase their reliance on the more proximal lower-limb joints (i.e. the knee and the hip) to absorb mechanical energy and stabilize fall recovery. Further investigations into the muscle-tendon mechanics underlying these joint-level responses will likely provide additional insights into the neuromotor control strategies used to regain the stability following unexpected perturbations and provide biological inspiration for the future design of wearable devices capable of performing within unpredictable environments."

Characterization of normal and abnormal Gait has been a major research field for decades, whether in fall prevention, sports biomechanics or even disease indication. In this paper, we assess time domain statistical properties of the Vertical Ground Reaction Force (VGRF) during moderate-pace walking, aiming eventually to create a reliable mathematical model of VGRF for normal and abnormal cases. For that endeavor, first order statistical analysis was performed upon signal segmentation in order to determine the degree of stationarity and base the model upon it. Furthermore, we performed curve fitting of the VGRF time series between present and past values, which led us to model the waveform with linear regression via Autoregressive Model for both Normal Walking Signals and Parkinson diseased patients' walking signals. However this is done only for one chosen sensor. However, it would be crucial to take the advantage of the array of sensors. Evaluating the cross-covariance between multi-sensor data of a given subject at different time lags capture the most important information. The seasonality in the values give a quite important indications of the behavior of data. The objective behind this analysis is to recommend a preliminary basis to create reliable mathematical model of normal walking signals versus pathological walking signals, that we will emphasize in a complementary work, in the simplest way available and creating fall prevention indicators for old patients.

The push-off mechanism to generate forward movement in skating has been analyzed by using high-speed cameras and specially designed skates because it is closely related to skater performance. However, using high-speed cameras for such an investigation, it is hard to measure the three-dimensional push-off force, and a skate with strain gauges is difficult to implement in the real competitions. In this study, we provided a new method to evaluate the three-dimensional push-off angle in short-track speed skating based on motion analysis using a wearable motion analysis system with inertial measurement unit sensors to avoid using a special skate or specific equipment insert into the skate for measurement of push-off force. The estimated push-off angle based on motion analysis data was very close to that based on push-off force with a small root mean square difference less than 6% when using the lateral marker in the left leg and the medial marker in the right leg regardless of skating phase. These results indicated that the push-off angle estimation based on motion analysis data using a wearable motion capture system of inertial measurement unit sensors could be acceptable for realistic situations. The proposed method was shown to be feasible during short-track speed skating. This study is meaningful because it can provide a more acceptable push-off angle estimation in real competitive situations."

The main reason for this is the complexity of hand biomechanics, where several degrees of freedom are distributed along a continuous deformable structure.

However, the intrinsic accuracy (as well as the number of sensing elements) of wearable hand pose reconstruction (HPR) systems can be severely limited by ergonomics and cost considerations. In this paper, we combined the theoretical foundations of the optimal design of HPR devices based on hand synergy information, i.e., the inter-joint covariation patterns, with textile goniometers based on knitted piezoresistive fabrics (KPF) technology, to develop, for the first time, an optimally-designed under-sensed glove for measuring hand kinematics.

The objective of this study was to evaluate if a multi-sensor system (milk, activity, body posture) was a better classifier for lameness than the single-sensor-based detection models. Between September 2013 and August 2014, 3629 cow observations were collected on a commercial dairy farm in Belgium. Human locomotion scoring was used as reference for the model development and evaluation. Cow behaviour and performance was measured with existing sensors that were already present at the farm. A prototype of three-dimensional-based video recording system was used to quantify automatically the back posture of a cow. For the single predictor comparisons, a receiver operating characteristics curve was made. For the multivariate detection models, logistic regression and generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were developed. The best lameness classification model was obtained by the multi-sensor analysis (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC)=0.757±0.029), containing a combination of milk and milking variables, activity and gait and posture variables from videos. Second, the multivariate video-based system (AUC=0.732±0.011) performed better than the multivariate milk sensors (AUC=0.604±0.026) and the multivariate behaviour sensors (AUC=0.633±0.018). The video-based system performed better than the combined behaviour and performance-based detection model (AUC=0.669±0.028), indicating that it is worthwhile to consider a video-based lameness detection system, regardless the presence of other existing sensors in the farm. The results suggest that Θ2, the feature variable for the back curvature around the hip joints, with an AUC of 0.719 is the best single predictor variable for lameness detection based on locomotion scoring. In general, this study showed that the video-based back posture monitoring system is outperforming the behaviour and performance sensing techniques for locomotion scoring-based lameness detection. A GLMM with seven specific variables (walking speed, back posture measurement, daytime activity, milk yield, lactation stage, milk peak flow rate and milk peak conductivity) is the best combination of variables for lameness classification. The accuracy on four-level lameness classification was 60.3%. The accuracy improved to 79.8% for binary lameness classification. The binary GLMM obtained a sensitivity of 68.5% and a specificity of 87.6%, which both exceed the sensitivity (52.1%±4.7%) and specificity (83.2%±2.3%) of the multi-sensor logistic regression model. This shows that the repeated measures analysis in the GLMM, taking into account the individual history of the animal, outperforms the classification when thresholds based on herd level (a statistical population) are used.

A review of these studies raises concerns that this body of literature is presenting over-optimistic results in light of small sample sizes, questionable modelling decisions and problematic validation methodologies (e.g. inherent problems with the overly-popular cross-validation technique, lack of external validation). There seem to be substantial issues in the feature selection process, whereby researchers select features before modelling begins based on their relation to the target, and either perform no validation or test the models on the same data used for their training.

Indeed, the availability of rich sensor data and many analytical options provides intellectual and creative freedom for researchers, but should be treated with caution, and such pitfalls must be avoided if we desire to create generalisable prognostic tools of any clinical value.

Bilateral and unilateral vertical jumps were performed to evaluate the functional performance and a single inertial sensor unit was employed in order to collect 3D acceleration and 3D orientation data. Previously ACL-reconstructed analysed athletes demonstrated significant (p < 0.05) alterations in relation to the three-dimensional axis (X-Y-Z) supported accelerations and differing jump phase durations, including jumping performance values, in both bilateral and unilateral jumping manoeuvres several years after ACL reconstruction. Identification of the encountered deficits through the use of an IU devise could provide clinicians with a new reliable tool for movement analysis in a clinical setting."

We developed and evaluated a new kinematic driver for musculoskeletal models using ambulatory inertial and magnetic measurement units (IMMUs). The new driver uses the orientation estimates based on sensor fusion of each individual IMMU and benefits from two important properties of musculoskeletal models. First, these models contain more complex, anatomical, kinematic models than those currently used for sensor fusion of multiple IMMUs and are continuously improved. Second, they allow movement between segment and measured sensor. For three different tasks, the new IMMU driver, (optical) marker drivers and a combination of both were used to reconstruct the motion. Maximal root mean square (RMS) joint angle differences with respect to the silver standard (combined IMMU/marker drivers) were found for the hip joint; 4°, 2° and 5° during squat, gait and slideboard tasks for IMMU-driven reconstructions, compared with 6°, 5° and 5° for marker-driven reconstructions, respectively. The measured angular velocities corresponded best to the IMMU-driven reconstructions, with a maximal RMS difference of 66°/s, compared with 108°/s and 91°/s for marker-driven reconstructions and silver standard. However, large oscillations in global accelerations occurred during IMMU-driven reconstructions resulting in a maximal RMS difference with respect to measured acceleration of 23 m/s<sup>2</sup>, compared with 9 m/s<sup>2</sup> for reconstructions that included marker drivers.

Noninvasive motion capture using small low-power wearable sensors and camera systems have been explored, however, drift and occlusions have limited their ability to reliably capture motion over long durations. In this paper, we propose to combine 3D pose estimation from inertial motion capture with 2D pose estimation from vision to obtain more robust posture tracking. To handle the changing appearance of the human body due to pose variations and illumination changes, our implementation is based upon Least Soft-Threshold Squares Tracking.

The aim of this study was to clarify the physiological mechanisms of tongue pressure and to investigate the temporal relationship among tongue pressure, supra-hyoid muscle activity, and videofluorographic (VF) images during swallowing. Fifteen healthy young subjects participated. Tongue pressure measured using a sensor sheet with five channels, electromyographic EMG, and VF was recorded synchronously during 4-ml barium swallowing.

Tongue pressure production with a monophasic pattern appeared during the same period as the second peak in the biphasic pattern. The onset of tongue pressure was later than the start of hyoid movement and onset of EMG, and offset was observed between the hyoid at the up-forward position and reposition. Onset of tongue pressure at the anterior area was correlated with the start of slight hyoid elevation. Offset of tongue pressure at the posterio-lateral points was strongly time locked with the hyoid at the up-forward position.

Joint moment measurements represent an objective biomechanical parameter of knee joint load in knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Wearable sensors in combination with machine learning techniques may provide solutions to develop assistive devices in KOA patients to improve disease treatment and to minimize risk of non-functional overreaching (e.g., pain). The purpose of this study was to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) that estimates external knee flexion moments (KFM) and external knee adduction moments (KAM) during various locomotion tasks, based on data obtained by two wearable sensors. Thirteen participants were instrumented with two inertial measurement units (IMUs) located on the right thigh and shank. Participants performed six different locomotion tasks consisting of linear motions and motions with a change of direction, while IMU signals as well as full body kinematics and ground reaction forces were synchronously recorded. KFM and KAM were determined using a full body biomechanical model. An ANN was trained to estimate the KFM and KAM time series using the IMU signals as input. Evaluation of the ANN was done using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Concordance of the ANN-estimated KFM and reference data was categorized for five tasks (walking straight, 90° walking turn, moderate running, 90° running turn and 45° cutting maneuver) as strong (<i>r</i> ≥ 0.69, rRMSE ≤ 23.1) and as moderate for fast running (<i>r</i> = 0.65 ± 0.43, rRMSE = 25.5 ± 7.0%). For all locomotion tasks, KAM yielded a lower concordance in comparison to the KFM, ranging from weak (<i>r</i> ≤ 0.21, rRMSE ≥ 33.8%) in cutting and fast running to strong (<i>r</i> = 0.71 ± 0.26, rRMSE = 22.3 ± 8.3%) for walking straight. Smallest mean difference of classical discrete load metrics was seen for KFM impulse, 10.6 ± 47.0%. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using only two IMUs to estimate KFM and KAM to a limited extent. This methodological step facilitates further work that should aim to improve the estimation accuracy to provide valuable biofeedback systems for KOA patients. Greater accuracy of effective implementation could be achieved by a participant- or task-specific ANN modeling."

One commonly employed computational technique to reduce these types of artifacts is Independent Component Analysis (ICA). ICA estimates statistically independent components (ICs) that, when linearly combined, closely match the input (sensor) data. Removing the ICs that represent artifact sources and re-mixing the sources returns the input data with reduced noise activity. ICs of real-world data are usually not perfectly separated, actual sources, but a mixture of these sources. Adding additional input signals, predominantly generated by a single IC that is already part of the original sensor data, should increase that IC's separability. We conducted this study to evaluate this concept for ICA-based electromyogenic artifact reduction in EEG using EMG signals as additional inputs. To acquire the appropriate data we worked with nine human volunteers. The EEG and EMG were recorded while the study volunteers performed seven exercises designed to produce a wide range of representative myogenic artifacts. To evaluate the effect of the EMG signals we estimated the sources of each dataset once with and once without the EMG data. The ICs were automatically classified as either `myogenic' or `non-myogenic'. We removed the former before back projection. Afterwards we calculated an objective measure to quantify the artifact reduction and assess the effect of including EMG signals. Our study showed that the ICA-based reduction of electromyogenic artifacts can be improved by including the EMG data of artifact-inducing muscles. This approach could prove beneficial for locomotor disorder research, brain-computer interfaces, neurofeedback, and most other areas where brain activity during movement has to be analyzed. "

So far, most of the available systems for the SCG assessment are designed to be used in a laboratory or in controlled behavioral and environmental conditions. In this paper we propose a modified version of a textile-based wearable device for the unobtrusive recording of ECG, respiration and accelerometric data (the MagIC system), to assess the 3d sternal SCG in daily life. SCG is characterized by an extremely low magnitude of the accelerations (in the order of g × 10(-3)), and is masked by major body accelerations induced by locomotion. Thus in daily life recordings, SCG can be measured whenever the subject is still. We observed that about 30 seconds of motionless behavior are sufficient for a stable estimate of the average SCG waveform, independently from the subject's posture. Since it is likely that during spontaneous behavior the subject may stay still for at least 30 seconds several times in a day, it is expected that the SCG could be repeatedly estimated and tracked over time through a prolonged data recording. These observations represent the first testing of the system in the assessment of SCG out of a laboratory environment, and open the possibility to perform SCG studies in a wide range of everyday conditions without interfering with the subject's activity tasks."

Many animals, including humans, rely on active tactile sensing to explore the environment and negotiate obstacles, especially in the dark. Here, we model a descending neural pathway that mediates short-latency proprioceptive information from a tactile sensor on the head to thoracic neural networks. We studied the nocturnal stick insect Carausius morosus, a model organism for the study of adaptive locomotion, including tactually mediated reaching movements. Like mammals, insects need to move their tactile sensors for probing the environment. Cues about sensor position and motion are therefore crucial for the spatial localization of tactile contacts and the coordination of fast, adaptive motor responses. Our model explains how proprioceptive information about motion and position of the antennae, the main tactile sensors in insects, can be encoded by a single type of mechanosensory afferents. Moreover, it explains how this information is integrated and mediated to thoracic neural networks by a diverse population of descending interneurons (DINs). First, we quantified responses of a DIN population to changes in antennal position, motion and direction of movement. Using principal component (PC) analysis, we find that only two PCs account for a large fraction of the variance in the DIN response properties. We call the two-dimensional space spanned by these PCs 'coding-space' because it captures essential features of the entire DIN population. Second, we model the mechanoreceptive input elements of this descending pathway, a population of proprioceptive mechanosensory hairs monitoring deflection of the antennal joints. Finally, we propose a computational framework that can model the response properties of all important DIN types, using the hair field model as its only input. This DIN model is validated by comparison of tuning characteristics, and by mapping the modelled neurons into the two-dimensional coding-space of the real DIN population. This reveals the versatility of the framework for modelling a complete descending neural pathway. "

The focus is on-field biomechanical data collection, and the translation of that data to injury metrics and helmet evaluation. On-field data has been collected with video analysis for laboratory reconstructions or wearable head impact sensors. Concussion biomechanics have been studied across all levels of play, from youth to professional, which has allowed for comparison of head impact exposure and injury tolerance between different age groups. In general, head impact exposure and injury tolerance increase with increasing age. Average values for concussive head impact kinematics are lower for youth players in both linear and rotational acceleration. Head impact data from concussive and non-concussive events have been used to develop injury metrics and risk functions for use in protective equipment evaluation. These risk functions have been used to evaluate helmet performance for each level of play, showing substantial differences in the ability of different helmet models to reduce concussion risk. New advances in head impact sensor technology allow for biomechanical measurements in helmeted and non-helmeted sports for a more complete understanding of concussion tolerance in different demographics. These sensors along with advances in finite element modeling will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of injury and human tolerance to head impact."

This paper presents a new muscle contraction (MC) sensor. This MC sensor is based on a novel principle whereby muscle tension is measured during muscle contractions. During the measurement, the sensor is fixed on the skin surface above the muscle, while the sensor tip applies pressure and causes an indentation of the skin and intermediate layer directly above the muscle and muscle itself. The force on the sensor tip is then measured. This force is roughly proportional to the tension of the muscle. The measurement is non-invasive and selective. Selectivity of MC measurement refers to the specific muscle or part of the muscle that is being measured and is limited by the size of the sensor tip. The sensor is relatively small and light so that the measurements can be performed while the measured subject performs different activities. Test measurements with this MC sensor on the biceps brachii muscle under isometric conditions (elbow angle 90°) showed a high individual linear correlation between the isometric force and MC signal amplitudes (0.97 ≤ r ≤ 1). The measurements also revealed a strong correlation between the MC and electromyogram (EMG) signals as well as good dynamic behaviour by the MC sensor. We believe that this MC sensor, when fully tested, will be a useful device for muscle mechanic diagnostics and that it will be complementary to existing methods."

The T10MWs were recorded under three conditions: standard (wearing shoes), reduced grip (wearing socks) and increased cognitive load (backward-counting dual-task). PwPMS showed worse kinematics of gait and increased muscle coactivation than controls at both the thigh and leg levels. Both reduced grip and increased cognitive load caused a reduction in the cadence and velocity of the T10MW, which were correlated with one another. A higher coactivation index at the thigh level of the more affected side was positively correlated with the time of the T10MW (r = 0.5, <i>p</i> < 0.01), Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (r = 0.4, <i>p</i> < 0.05), and negatively correlated with the cadence (r = -0.6, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Our results suggest that excessive coactivation at the thigh level is the major determinant of the gait performance as the disease progresses. Moreover, demanding walking conditions do not influence gait in controls but deteriorate walking performances in PwPMS, thus those conditions should be prevented during hospital examinations as well as in homecare environments."

This insole was rationally designed as a composite structure to fully utilize the pressure distribution of a footfall for wearable electricity generation and to deliver a power output reaching 580 μW. The insole was additionally able to withstand use in harsh environments, including pluvial conditions, without affecting the power output consistency. A total of 260 light-emitting diodes were lit up with perspiring feet and water on the floor, and a capacitor of 88 μF was charged to 2.5 V in 900 s. This work represents a practical approach to developing a highly efficient and robust smart insole that can be used as a sustainable power source for wearable bioelectronics."

However, the biomechanical moment due to gravity is a nonlinear function of shoulder elevation angle and, thus, challenging to counteract proportionally across the shoulder elevation range of motion with a spring alone. We designed, fabricated, and tested an integrated spring-cam-wheel system that can generate a nonlinear moment to proportionally compensate for the expected antigravity moment at the shoulder.

The rotational moment measured from the benchtop model closely matched the theoretical moment during simulated positive shoulder elevation. However, a larger moment (up to 12.5% larger) was required during simulated negative shoulder elevation to stretch the spring to its initial length due to spring hysteresis and friction losses.

Since changes in running terrain have been shown to influence running gait mechanics, the purpose of this study was to use a machine learning approach to objectively determine relevant accelerometer-based features to discriminate between running patterns in different environments and determine the generalizability of observed differences in running patterns. Center of mass accelerations were recorded for recreational runners in treadmill-only (<i>n</i> = 28) and sidewalk-only (<i>n</i> = 25) environments, and an independent group (<i>n</i> = 16) ran in both treadmill and sidewalk environments. A feature selection algorithm was used to develop a training dataset from treadmill-only and sidewalk-only running. A binary support vector machine model was trained to classify treadmill and sidewalk running. Classification accuracy was determined using 10-fold cross-validation of the training dataset and an independent testing dataset from the runners that ran in both environments. Nine features related to the consistency and variability of center of mass accelerations were selected. Specifically, there was greater ratio of vertical acceleration during treadmill running and a greater ratio of anterior-posterior acceleration during sidewalk running in both the training and testing dataset. Step and stride regularity were significantly greater in the treadmill condition for the vertical axis in both the training and testing dataset, and in the medial-lateral axis for the testing dataset. During sidewalk running, there was significantly greater variability in the magnitude of the vertical and anterior-posterior accelerations for both datasets. The classification accuracy based on 10-fold cross-validation of the training dataset (<i>M</i> = 93.17%, SD = 2.43%) was greater than the classification accuracy of the independent testing dataset (<i>M</i> = 83.81%, SD = 3.39%).

The cervical spine kinematics was measured by both the Rift and a reference motion tracking system. Comparison of the kinematics data between the Rift and the tracking system indicated that the Rift can provide good estimates on full range of motion (from one side to the other side) during the performed task. Because of inertial sensor drifting, the unilateral range of motion (from one side to neutral posture) derived from the Rift is more erroneous. The root-mean-square errors over a 1-min task were within 10° for each rotation axis. The error analysis further indicated that the inertial sensor drifted approximately 6° at the beginning of a trial during the initialization.

In contrast to most previous studies, in which disc pressure was measured in the fluidic nucleus pulposus, these sensors may be used to measure in vivo dynamic compressive stresses in the annulus at magnitudes typical of the musculoskeletal system in a large animal over a relatively long post-operative time."

Results from a set of experiments involving several users walking at different inclinations on a treadmill confirm the feasibility of our approach. A statistical analysis of slope estimations shows in first instance that the technique is capable of distinguishing the different slopes of the walking surface for every subject.

A six-component handrim dynamometer (HRD) is a dynamometer that rotates around the wheel axle during measurements. For this kind of dynamometer, static zero level calibration is insufficient because the proportion of the forces (i.e. handrim weight and centrifugal force) measured by each sensor varies according to the angular position and velocity of the dynamometer. The dynamic calibration presented in this paper is based on the direct correction of the sensor signals using Fourier's polynomials that take into account the influences of both the handrim weight distribution on the sensors with respect to the wheel's angular position and the effect of the wheel's angular velocity. When these corrections were applied to the signals produced by the sensors while the HRD was rotating and no effort was being exerted on the handrim, the calculated forces and torques remained close to zero, as expected. Based on these results, the wheel dynamometer can be confidently used for studying manual wheelchair locomotion under various real conditions. The method could also be applied in other situations in which a dynamometer rotates during measurements."

In particular, gains in sensor durability might leverage insight from the compound end organ of the slowly adapting type I afferent, especially its multiple sites of spike initiation that reset each other.

The biomechanics of a golf swing have been of interest to golfers, instructors, and biomechanists. In addition to the complexity of the three-dimensional (3D) dynamics of multi-segments of body, the closed-chain body posture as a result of both hands holding a club together makes it difficult to fully analyze the 3D kinetics of a golf swing. To identify the hand-grip joint force and torque applied by each hand, we directly measured the 3D internal grip force of nine registered professional golfers using an instrumented grip. A six-axis force-torque sensor was connected to a custom-made axially separated grip, which was then connected to a driver shaft using a manufactured screw thread. Subjects participated in two sessions of data collection featuring five driver swings with both a regular and customized sensor-embedded grip, respectively. Internal grip force measurement and upper limb kinematics were used to calculate the joint force and torque of the nine-linkage closed-chain of the upper limb and club using 3D inverse dynamics. Direct measurement of internal grip forces revealed a threefold greater right-hand torque application compared to the left hand, and counterforce by both hands was also found. The joint force and torque of the left arm tended to precede that of the right arm, the majority of which had peaks around the impact and showed a larger magnitude than that of the left arm. Due to the practical challenge of measuring internal force, heuristic estimation methods based on club kinematics showed fair approximation.

This paper presents a novel hierarchical information fusion algorithm to obtain human global displacement for different gait patterns, including walking, running, and hopping based on seven body-worn inertial and magnetic measurement units. In the first-level sensor fusion, the orientation for each segment is achieved by a complementary Kalman filter (CKF) which compensates for the orientation error of the inertial navigation system solution through its error state vector. For each foot segment, the displacement is also estimated by the CKF, and zero velocity update is included for the drift reduction in foot displacement estimation. Based on the segment orientations and left/right foot locations, two global displacement estimates can be acquired from left/right lower limb separately using a linked biomechanical model. In the second-level geometric fusion, another Kalman filter is deployed to compensate for the difference between the two estimates from the sensor fusion and get more accurate overall global displacement estimation.

The aim of this work was to develop an innovative multivariate plausibility assessment (MPA) algorithm in order to differentiate between 'physiologically normal', 'physiologically extreme' and 'implausible' observations in simultaneously recorded data. The underlying concept is based on the fact that different measurable parameters are often physiologically linked. If physiologically extreme observations occur due to disease, incident or hormonal cycles, usually more than one measurable trait is affected. In contrast, extreme values of a single trait are most likely implausible if all other traits show values in a normal range.

The most common disorders of the musculoskeletal system are low back disorders. They cause significant direct and indirect costs to different societies especially in lifting occupations. To reduce the risk of low back disorders, mechanical lifting aids have been used to decrease low back muscle forces. But there are very few direct ways to calculate muscle forces and examine the effect of personal lift-assist devices, so biomechanical models ought to be used to examine the quality of these devices for assisting back muscles in lifting tasks. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of a designed wearable lift-assist vest (WLAV) in the reduction of erector spinae muscle forces during symmetric squat lifting tasks. Two techniques of muscle calculation were used, the electromyography-based method and the optimization-based model. The first uses electromyography data of erector spinae muscles and its linear relationship with muscle force to estimate their forces, and the second uses a developed musculoskeletal model to calculate back muscle forces using an optimization-based method. The results show that these techniques reduce the average value of erector spinae muscle forces by 45.38 (± 4.80) % and 42.03 (± 8.24) % respectively. Also, both methods indicated approximately the same behaviour in changing muscle forces during 10 to 60 degrees of trunk flexion using WLAV. The use of WLAV can help to reduce the activity of low back muscles in lifting tasks by transferring the external load effect to the assistive spring system utilized in it, so this device may help people lift for longer."

A practical method that is not sensor-specific for the optimal tuning of the extended Kalman filter covariance matrices is provided. It uses reference data obtained from a stereophotogrammetric system but it has to be tuned only once since it is task-specific only.

This is required as in an indoor localization scenario, the smartphone is often used to display a user interface of some navigation application and thus needs to be carried in hand. For evaluation the well known MobiAct dataset for the pocket-case as well as a novel dataset for the hand-case were used. The approach based on analytical transformations surpassed the other approaches resulting in accuracies of 98.0% for pocket-case and 81.8% for the hand-case trained on the combination of both datasets. With activity recognition in the supporting role of indoor localization, this accuracy is acceptable, but has room for further improvement."

The focus of this study was to evaluate different intent recognition interfaces, which if configured properly, may be capable of providing more natural transitions between locomotion modes.

The purpose of this study was to quantify the changes in temporal coordination of the finger joints during different power grips with an ulnar nerve block by means of a sensor glove. In 21 healthy subjects, the onset and end of the active flexion of the 14 finger joints when gripping objects of different diameters was recorded by a sensor glove. The measurement was repeated after an ulnar nerve block was applied in a standardized setting. The change in the temporal coordination of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints with and without the nerve block was calculated within the same subject. In healthy subjects, the MCP joints started their movement prior to the PIP joints in the middle and ring finger, whereas this occurred in the reverse order at the index and little finger. The DIP joint onset was significantly delayed (P<0.01). With the ulnar nerve block, this coordination shifted towards simultaneous onset of all joints, independent of the grip diameter. The thumb and index finger were affected the least. With an ulnar nerve block, the PIP joints completed their movement prior to the MCP joints when gripping small objects (G1 and G2), whereas the order was reversed with larger objects (G3 and G4). The alterations with ulnar nerve block affected mainly the little finger when gripping small objects. With larger diameter objects, all fingers had a significant delay at the end of the PIP joint movement relative to the MCP and DIP joints, and the PIP and DIP joint sequence was reversed (P<0.01). Based on the significant changes in temporal coordination of finger flexion during different power grips, there are biomechanical effects of loss of function of the intrinsic muscles caused by an ulnar nerve block on the fine motor skills of the hand. This can be important for the diagnosis and rehabilitation of ulnar nerve lesions of the hand."

Impaired walking increases injury risk during locomotion, including falls-related acute injuries and overuse damage to lower limb joints. Gait impairments seriously restrict voluntary, habitual engagement in injury prevention activities, such as recreational walking and exercise.

Gait control using shoe-insoles has potential as an effective population-based intervention, and new sensor technologies will enhance the effectiveness of these devices.

The neurons are sensitive to the velocity of antennal movements across the entire range covered by natural movements, regardless of movement direction and joint angle.

This paper presents a vision-based force measurement method using an artificial neural network model. The proposed model is used for measuring the applied load to a spherical biological cell during micromanipulation process. The devised vision-based method is most useful when force measurement capability is required, but it is very challenging or even infeasible to use a force sensor. Artificial neural networks in conjunction with image processing techniques have been used to estimate the applied load to a cell. A bio-micromanipulation system capable of force measurement has also been established in order to collect the training data required for the proposed neural network model. The geometric characterization of zebrafish embryos membranes has been performed during the penetration of the micropipette prior to piercing. The geometric features are extracted from images using image processing techniques. These features have been used to describe the shape and quantify the deformation of the cell at different indentation depths. The neural network is trained by taking the visual data as the input and the measured corresponding force as the output. Once the neural network is trained with sufficient number of data, it can be used as a precise sensor in bio-micromanipulation setups. However, the proposed neural network model is applicable for indentation of any other spherical elastic object. The results demonstrate the capability of the proposed method. The outcomes of this study could be useful for measuring force in biological cell micromanipulation processes such as injection of the mouse oocyte/embryo. "

In this study, we proposed a continuous stroke phase recognition method with lower-limb inertial signals. The aim of the method was to decrease the time needed and to relieve the burdensome manual configurations in the tasks of human underwater motion recognition. The method automatically segmented the data of a period of time into stroke cycles and three sub-phases (propulsion, glide and recovery). K-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN) was used as the classifier to train the segmented data and classify the new data on each sample interval. To validate the proposed recognition method, three elite swimmers were recruited. We also designed an wearable sensing system for human underwater motion sensing with inertial measurement units (IMUs). With only data of 5 stroke cycles for training, the recognizer produced accurate recognition results. The average precision across the phases and the subjects was 93.7% and the average recall was 92.6%. We also investigated the time difference of the key stroke events (stroke phase transitions) between the recognized decisions and the reference ones. The average time difference was 66.2 ms, which accounted for the 4.2% of a single stroke phase. The results of the pilot study proved the feasibility of the new method for human aquatic locomotion assistance tasks. Future efforts will be paid in this new direction for more promising results."

Humans walk and run, as well as change their gait speed, through the control of their complicated and redundant musculoskeletal system. These gaits exhibit different locomotor behaviors, such as a double-stance phase in walking and flight phase in running. The complex and redundant nature of the musculoskeletal system and the wide variation in locomotion characteristics lead us to imagine that the motor control strategies for these gaits, which remain unclear, are extremely complex and differ from one another. It has been previously proposed that muscle activations may be generated by linearly combining a small set of basic pulses produced by central pattern generators (muscle synergy hypothesis). This control scheme is simple and thought to be shared between walking and running at different speeds. Demonstrating that this control scheme can generate walking and running and change the speed is critical, as bipedal locomotion is dynamically challenging. Here, we provide such a demonstration by using a motor control model with 69 parameters developed based on the muscle synergy hypothesis. Specifically, we show that it produces both walking and running of a human musculoskeletal model by changing only seven key motor control parameters. Furthermore, we show that the model can walk and run at different speeds by changing only the same seven parameters based on the desired speed. These findings will improve our understanding of human motor control in locomotion and provide guiding principles for the control design of wearable exoskeletons and prostheses."

In order to develop closed-loop therapeutic strategies, including deep brain stimulation, a reliable means of detecting freezing episodes is required. By using wearable accelerometers, freezing episodes can be detected with energy-based algorithms when the ratio of the energy in the freeze band (3 to 8 Hz) to that of the locomotion band (0.5 to 3 Hz) is above a patient-specific threshold.

The final morphological model was used to simulate the contact patterns that would be generated as a rat uses its whiskers to tactually explore objects with varying curvatures. The simulations demonstrate that altering the morphology of the array changes the relationship between the sensory signals acquired and the curvature of the object. The morphology of the vibrissal array thus directly constrains the nature of the neural computations that can be associated with extraction of a particular object feature. These results illustrate the key role that the physical embodiment of the sensor array plays in the sensing process."

The treadmill velocities were selected to match the range of velocities used overgroud. SL vs. velocity plots were generated for treadmill and overground data for each participant and fit with a 2<sup>nd</sup> order polynomial in the form of SL=Av<sup>2</sup>+Bv+C. Each equation coefficient (i.e., A, B, C) was averaged across participants and compared between treadmill and overground using paired t-tests. The A coefficient (v<sup>2</sup> term) was different treadmill vs. overground (p=0.031). Neither B (p=0.136) nor C (p=0.260) coefficients were different treadmill vs. overground. It was concluded that the A coefficient (v<sup>2</sup> term) for SL vs. velocity was larger during overground vs. treadmill running. This is an indication that the strategy of changing SL across velocities was different when on the treadmill vs. overground. Specifically, while running on a treadmill, SL continued to increase in a more linear manner than when running overground."

Perlecan is a heparan sulphate proteoglycan that transiently displays native CS sulphation motifs 4-C-3 and 7-D-4 during tissue morphogenesis these are expressed by progenitor cell populations during tissue development. Perlecan is susceptible to fragmentation by proteases during tissue development and in pathological tissues particularly in domains IV and V. The fragmentation pattern of domain IV has been suggested as a means of grading prostate cancer. Domain V of perlecan is of interest due to its interactive properties with integrin α5β1 that promotes pericyte migration enhancing PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of PDGFRβ, Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-2, and focal adhesion kinase supporting the repair of the blood brain barrier following ischaemic stroke.

Perlecan attached to the luminal surfaces of endothelial cells in blood vessels acts as a flow sensor that signals back to endothelial and smooth muscle cells to regulate vascular tone and blood pressure. Perlecan also acts as a flow sensor in the lacuno-canalicular space regulating osteocytes and bone homeostasis. Along with its biomechanical regulatory properties in cartilaginous tissues this further extends the functional repertoire of this amazingly diverse functional proteoglycan."

The validity of the method was assessed by comparing the inclination of the ski and the slope at landing point and reported an error of -0.2±4.8°. The validity was also assessed by comparison of characteristic angles obtained with the proposed system and reference values in the literature; the differences were smaller than 6° for 75% of the angles and smaller than 15° for 90% of the angles. The sensitivity to different performances was evaluated by comparing the angles between two groups of athletes with different jump lengths and by assessing the association between angles and jump lengths. The differences of technique observed between athletes and the associations with jumps length agreed with the literature.

The use of home-based image sensors for biological and environmental monitoring provides novel insight into health and development but it is difficult to evaluate people during their normal activities in their home. Therefore, we developed a low-cost infrared (IR) technology-based motion, location, temperature and thermal environment detection system that can be used non-invasively for long-term studies in the home environment. We tested this technology along with the associated analysis algorithm to visualize the effects of parental care and thermal environment on developmental state change in a non-human primate model, the common marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>). To validate this system, we first compared it to a manual analysis technique and we then assessed the development of circadian rhythms in common marmosets from postnatal day 15-45. The semi-automatically tracked biological indices of locomotion velocity (BV) and body surface temperature (BT) and the potential psychological index of place preference toward the door (BD), showed age-dependent shifts in circadian phase patterns. Although environmental variables appeared to affect circadian rhythm development, principal component analysis and signal superimposing imaging methods revealed a novel phasic pattern of BD-BT correlation day/night switching in animals older than postnatal day 38 (approximately equivalent to one year of age in humans). The origin of this switch was related to earlier development of body temperature (BT) rhythms and alteration of psychological behavior rhythms (BD) around earlier feeding times. We propose that this cost-effective, inclusive sensing and analytic technique has value for understanding developmental care conditions for which continual home non-invasive monitoring would be beneficial and further suggest the potential to adapt this technique for use in humans."

In underwater locomotion, extracting meaningful information from local flows is as desirable as it is challenging, due to complex fluid-structure interaction. Sensing and motion are tightly interconnected; hydrodynamic signals generated by the external stimuli are modified by the self-generated flow signals. Given that very little is known about self-generated signals, we used onboard pressure sensors to measure the pressure profiles over the head of a fusiform-shape craft while moving forward and backward harmonically. From these measurements we obtained a second-order polynomial model which incorporates the velocity and acceleration of the craft to estimate the surface pressure within the swimming range up to one body length/second (L s(-1)). The analysis of the model reveals valuable insights into the temporal and spatial changes of the pressure intensity as a function of craft's velocity. At low swimming velocities (<0.2 L s(-1)) the pressure signals are more sensitive to the acceleration of the craft than its velocity. However, the inertial effects gradually become less important as the velocity increases. The sensors on the front part of the craft are more sensitive to its movements than the sensors on the sides. With respect to the hydrostatic pressure measured in still water, the pressure detected by the foremost sensor reaches values up to 300 Pa at 1 L s(-1) swimming velocity, whereas the pressure difference between the foremost sensor and the next one is less than 50 Pa. Our results suggest that distributed pressure sensing can be used in a bimodal sensing strategy. The first mode detects external hydrodynamic events taking place around the craft, which requires minimal sensitivity to the self-motion of the craft. This can be accomplished by moving slowly with a constant velocity and by analyzing the pressure gradient as opposed to absolute pressure recordings. The second mode monitors the self-motion of the craft. It is shown here that distributed pressure sensing can be used as a speedometer to measure the craft's velocity."

A machine learning approach to MTC height estimation was investigated in this paper incorporating features from both raw and integrated inertial signals to train Generalized Regression Neural Networks (GRNN) models using a hill-climbing feature-selection method. The GRNN based MTC height predictions demonstrated root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 6.6mm with 9 optimum features for young adults and 7.1mm RMSE with 5 features for the older adults during treadmill walking. The GRNN based MTC height estimation method devised in this project represents approximately 68% less RMSE than other estimation techniques. The research findings show a strong potential for gait monitoring outside the laboratory to provide real-time MTC height information during everyday locomotion. "

Gait analysis methods to estimate spatiotemporal measures, based on two, three or four gyroscopes attached on lower limbs have been discussed in the literature. The most common approach to reduce the number of sensing units is to simplify the underlying biomechanical gait model. In this study, we propose a novel method based on prediction of movements of thighs from movements of shanks. Datasets from three previous studies were used. Data from the first study (ten healthy subjects and ten with Parkinson's disease) were used to develop and calibrate a system with only two gyroscopes attached on shanks. Data from two other studies (36 subjects with hip replacement, seven subjects with coxarthrosis, and eight control subjects) were used for comparison with the other methods and for assessment of error compared to a motion capture system. Results show that the error of estimation of stride length compared to motion capture with the system with four gyroscopes and our new method based on two gyroscopes was close (  -0.8 ±6.6 versus   3.8 ±6.6 cm). An alternative with three sensing units did not show better results (error:  -0.2 ±8.4 cm). Finally, a fourth that also used two units but with a simpler gait model had the highest bias compared to the reference (error:  -25.6 ±7.6 cm). We concluded that it is feasible to estimate movements of thighs from movements of shanks to reduce number of needed sensing units from 4 to 2 in context of ambulatory gait analysis."

Loads carried by the warfighter have increased substantially throughout recorded history, with the typical U.S. ground soldier carrying external loads averaging 45 kg during operations in Afghanistan. Incidence of disability in the U.S. Army has also increased sixfold since the 1980s, predominantly driven by increases in musculoskeletal injuries, with load carriage implicated as a possible mechanism. This article will provide a brief overview of the biomechanics of load carriage and will provide some recent insights into how the stress of the loads carried by military personnel can affect the musculoskeletal system. Studies into the biomechanics of load carriage have documented motion-related differences such as increased step rate, decreased stride length, and more trunk lean with increases in pack-borne loads. However, there is a paucity of literature on the relationship between load carriage and biomechanical mechanisms of overuse injury. Findings of recent studies will be presented, which add mechanistic information to increased stresses on the lower extremity. This was particularly true at the knee, where in one study, peak knee extension moment increased 115% when carrying a 55 kg load (0.87 ± 0.16 Nm·kg⁻¹) vs. no external load (0.40 ± 0.13 Nm·kg⁻¹). Efforts to model injury mechanisms require continued biomechanical measurements in humans while carrying occupationally relevant loads to be validated. Specifically, imaging technologies (e.g., bone geometry scans) should be incorporated to produce higher fidelity model of the stresses and strains experienced by the load carrier. In addition to laboratory-based biomechanics, data are needed to further explore the mechanistic relationship between load magnitude and injury; to this end, wearable sensors should continue to be exploited to accurately quantify biomechanical stresses related to load carriage in the field."

A ruminal transmitter unit was per os placed into the reticulum and therefore located in close proximity to the heart. The unit detected HR by the use of an acceleration sensor and also measured T(b). HR and T(b) signals were transmitted via short-distance UHF link to a repeater system located in a collar unit.

We have developed a software filter to remove this noise. Hence, the system was only capable of measuring HR in animals that showed little or no activity and in the absence of rumen contractions. Reliability of this 'stationary HR' measurement was confirmed with a second independent measurement of HR detected by an electrocardiogram in a domestic sheep (Ovis aries).4. In addition, we developed an algorithm to correctly classify an animal as 'active' or 'at rest' during each 3-min interval from the output of the activity sensors.

However, published accuracy studies on AHRS are mostly limited to a single task measured on a limited number of segments and participants. This study assessed AHRS sensors kinematics accuracy at multiple segments and joints through a variety of tasks not only to characterize the system's accuracy in these specific conditions, but also to extrapolate the accuracy results to a broader range of conditions using the characteristics of the movements (i.e. velocity and type of motion).

Muscle activity and fatigue performance parameters were obtained and compared between both a smart compression garment and the gold-standard, a surface electromyography (EMG) system during high-speed cycling in seven participants. The smart compression garment, based on force myography (FMG), comprised of integrated pressure sensors that were sandwiched between skin and garment, located on five thigh muscles. The muscle activity was assessed by means of crank cycle diagrams (polar plots) that displayed the muscle activity relative to the crank cycle. The fatigue was assessed by means of the median frequency of the power spectrum of the EMG signal; the fractal dimension (FD) of the EMG signal; and the FD of the pressure signal. The smart compression garment returned performance parameters (muscle activity and fatigue) comparable to the surface EMG. The major differences were that the EMG measured the electrical activity, whereas the pressure sensor measured the mechanical activity. As such, there was a phase shift between electrical and mechanical signals, with the electrical signals preceding the mechanical counterparts in most cases. This is specifically pronounced in high-speed cycling. The fatigue trend over the duration of the cycling exercise was clearly reflected in the fatigue parameters (FDs and median frequency) obtained from pressure and EMG signals. The fatigue parameter of the pressure signal (FD) showed a higher time dependency (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.84) compared to the EMG signal. This reflects that the pressure signal puts more emphasis on the fatigue as a function of time rather than on the origin of fatigue (e.g., peripheral or central fatigue). In light of the high-speed activity results, caution should be exerted when using data obtained from EMG for biomechanical models. In contrast to EMG data, activity data obtained from FMG are considered more appropriate and accurate as an input for biomechanical modeling as they truly reflect the mechanical muscle activity. In summary, the smart compression garment based on FMG is a valid alternative to EMG-garments and provides more accurate results at high-speed activity (avoiding the electro-mechanical delay), as well as clearly measures the progress of muscle fatigue over time."

With rumination time as response, each of the four feeding characteristics, milk yield, and lameness were tested in a second mixed model. On a visit basis, effects of feeding duration, lameness, and milk yield on feed intake were tested in a third mixed model. Overall, intra-individual variation was <15% and inter-individual variation was up to 50%. Lameness introduced more inter-individual variation in feeding characteristics (26-50%) compared to non-lame cows (17-29%). Lameness decreased daily feeding time and daily feeding frequency, but increased daily feeding rate. Interestingly, lameness did not affect daily rumination behaviors, fresh matter intake, or milk yield. On a visit basis, a high feeding rate was associated with a higher feed intake, a relationship that was exacerbated in the lame cows. In conclusion, cows can be characterized in particular by their feeding behavior, and lame cows differ from their non-lame pen-mates in terms of fewer feed station visits, faster eating, less time spent feeding, and more variable feeding behavior. Further, daily rumination time was slightly negatively associated with feeding rate, a relationship which calls for more research to quantify rumination efficiency relative to feeding rate. "

This paper reports on the development of a lens-less and image-sensor-less micro-electro-fluidic (MEF) approach for real-time monitoring of the locomotion of microscopic nematodes. The technology showed promise for overcoming the constraint of the limited field of view of conventional optical microscopy, with relatively low cost, good spatial resolution, and high portability. The core of the device was microelectrode grids formed by orthogonally arranging two identical arrays of microelectrode lines. The two microelectrode arrays were spaced by a microfluidic chamber containing a liquid medium of interest. As a nematode (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans) moved inside the chamber, the invasion of part of its body into some intersection regions between the microelectrodes caused changes in the electrical resistance of these intersection regions. The worm's presence at, or absence from, a detection unit was determined by a comparison between the measured resistance variation of this unit and a pre-defined threshold resistance variation. An electronic readout circuit was designed to address all the detection units and read out their individual electrical resistances. By this means, it was possible to obtain the electrical resistance profile of the whole MEF grid, and thus, the physical pattern of the swimming nematode. We studied the influence of a worm's body on the resistance of an addressed unit. We also investigated how the full-frame scanning and readout rates of the electronic circuit and the dimensions of a detection unit posed an impact on the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images of the nematode. Other important issues, such as the manufacturing-induced initial non-uniformity of the grids and the electrotaxic behaviour of nematodes, were also studied. A drug resistance screening experiment was conducted by using the grids with a good resolution of 30 × 30 μm(2). The phenotypic differences in the locomotion behaviours (e.g., moving speed and oscillation frequency extracted from the reconstructed images with the help of software) between the wild-type (N2) and mutant (lev-8) C. elegans worms in response to different doses of the anthelmintic drug, levamisole, were investigated. The locomotive parameters obtained by the MEF grids agreed well with those obtained by optical microscopy. Therefore, this technology will benefit whole-animal assays by providing a structurally simple, potentially cost-effective device capable of tracking the movement and phenotypes of important nematodes in various microenvironments."

Wearable hip protectors (padded garments) represent a promising strategy to decrease impact force and hip fracture risk during falls, and a wide range of products are currently marketed. However, little is known about how design features of hip protectors influence biomechanical effectiveness. We used a mechanical test system (simulating sideways falls) to measure the attenuation in femoral neck force provided by 26 commercially available hip protectors at three impact velocities (2, 3, and 4m/s). We also used a materials testing machine to characterize the force-deflection properties of each device. Regression analyses were performed to determine which geometric (e.g., height, width, thickness, volume) and force-deflection properties were associated with force attenuation. At an impact velocity of 3m/s, the force attenuation provided by the various hip protectors ranged between 2.5% and 40%. Hip protectors with lower stiffness (measured at 500N) provided greater force attenuation at all velocities. Protectors that absorbed more energy demonstrated greater force attenuation at the higher impact velocities (3 and 4m/s conditions), while protectors that did not directly contact (but instead bridged) the skin overlying the greater trochanter attenuated more force at velocities of 2 and 3m/s. At these lower velocities, the force attenuation provided by protectors that contacted the skin overlying the greater trochanter increased with increasing pad width, thickness, and energy dissipation. By providing a comparison of the protective value of a large range of existing hip protectors, these results can help to guide consumers and researchers in selecting hip protectors, and in interpreting the results of previous clinical trials. Furthermore, by determining geometric and material parameters that influence biomechanical performance, our results should assist manufacturers in designing devices that offer improved performance and clinical effectiveness."

A wearable actigraphy that records accelerometry, ambient light, and body temperature was used to monitor the sleep habits of 12 healthy subjects for two weeks before performing motor control and learning tests. The day of the motor test, the subjects filled two questionnaires about the quality of sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index - PSQI) and sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale - ESS).

An elbow flexion in the horizontal plane had to be performed on the correct time to reach the real target on a table at the same time as the virtual target on the screen. The subjects performed three sets of acquisition and transfer blocks of the coincident timing task. The subjects were clustered in two groups based on the PSQI and ESS scores.

GC was trained using several machine-learning approaches, both from feature-extracted data and from raw sensor data. Our best GC model achieved 97% accuracy. Our technique facilitated accurate, GC that enables in-depth biomechanical studies and allows for highly accurate phenotyping of gait for genetic research and breeding. Our approach lends itself for potential use in other quadrupedal species without the need for developing gait/animal specific algorithms."

A technique to animate a realistic hand avatar with 20 DoFs based on the biomechanics of the human hand is presented. The animation does not use any sensor glove or advanced tracker with markers.

This low-dimensional set of parameters is estimated from direct measurement of the motion of thumb and index finger tracked using two haptic devices. A kinematic inversion algorithm has been developed, which takes synergies into account and estimates the kinematic configuration of the whole hand, i.e., also of the fingers whose end tips are not directly tracked by the two haptic devices. The hand skin is deformable and its deformation is computed using a linear vertex blending technique. The proposed synergy-based animation of the hand avatar involves only algebraic computations and is suitable for real-time implementation as required in haptics. "

This validation also includes heterogeneous gait patterns from nine healthy subjects (27 ± 7.35 years) monitored at three self-selected paces (from 1 ± 0.2 to 2 ± 0.18 m/s) during forward walking on flat, rough, and inclined surfaces and climbing staircases. The proposed method was significantly more accurate ( ) and time effective (< 30.53 ± 9.88 ms, ) in a benchmarking analysis with a state-of-the-art method during 5657 steps. Heel strike was the gait event most accurately detected under controlled (accuracy of 100%) and real-life situations (accuracy > 96.98%). Misdetection was more pronounced in middle mid swing (accuracy > 90.12%). The lower computational load, together with an improved performance, makes this detection system suitable for quantitative benchmarking in the locomotor rehabilitation field."

A triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a potential solution for providing high output power by continuously harvesting ambient energy, which is expected to sustainably charge a battery for the new era-the era of the Internet of things and sensor networks. Generally, the existence of parasitic capacitance has been considered to be harmful in its output performance. Here, we systematically investigate the effects of structure and dimension of a TENG on its performance from the point view of parasitic capacitance by fabricating two types of layered TENGs with considering the dissimilarity of the two dielectric materials, symmetrical (ABBA) and alternate (ABAB) layered structure (SYM-TENG and ALT-TENG). Theoretical models of the two types of layered TENGs are proposed for illustrating their differences in parasitic capacitances and output characteristics.

They require some form of user input that defines the human intent. The purpose of this study was to develop a locomotion mode detection system and evaluate its performance for different sensor configurations and to study the effect of locomotion mode detection with and without electromyography (EMG) signals while using kinematic data from hip joint of non-dominant/impaired limb and an accelerometer. Data was collected from four able bodied subjects that completed two circuits that contained standing, level-walking, ramp ascent and descent and stair ascent and descent. By using only the kinematic data from the hip joint and accelerometer data the system was able to identify the transitions, stance and swing phases with similar performance as compared to using only EMG and accelerometer data. However, significant improvement in classification error was observed when EMG, kinematic and accelerometer data were used together to identify the locomotion modes. The higher recognition rates when using the kinematic data along with EMG shows that the joint kinematics could be beneficial in intent recognition systems of locomotion modes. "

The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of handle shape on the grip force distribution in the hand and on the muscle forces during maximal power grip tasks. Eleven subjects maximally grasped 3 handles with different external shapes (circular, elliptic, and double-frustum). A handle dynamometer, equipped with both a force sensor and a pressure map, was used to record the forces exerted at the hand/handle interface. The finger and wrist joint postures were also computed from synchronized kinematic measurement. These processed data were then used as input of a biomechanical hand model to estimate muscle forces. The results showed that handle shape influences the maximal grip force, the grip force distribution, and the finger joint postures. Particularly, we observed that the elliptical shape resulted in a 6.6% lower maximal grip force compared with the circular and double-frustum handle. Concomitantly, the estimated muscle forces also varied significantly according to the handle shape, with up to 48% differences for the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle for example. Interestingly, different muscle coordination strategies were observed depending on the handle shape, therefore suggesting a potential influence of these geometrical characteristics on pathological risks such as tendonitis.

Clinical experience has indicated that many complications during treatment with the Ilizarov method, and mainly tract infection, are related to decreased wire tension. The aim of this work was to evaluate biomechanically a novel wire tensioning and clamping system that will minimise or even diminish the reduction of the wire pretension during treatment. The proposed approach is based on threading of the wire end in a sufficient length. The wire pretension is applied by twisting a nut on the threaded part of the wires against the ring and is recorded by an incorporated force sensor. For biomechanical evaluation, the frame, consisting of a polyethylene bar, simulating the bone fragment, suspended on two rings, was subjected to a dynamic load of 0-800 N at a frequency of 0.5 Hz. After dynamic loading for 20 min, loss of the initial wire pretension for the novel clamping system ranged between 12 and 16%. The average loss for conventionally clamped wires was 75%. The advantages of the novel clamping system were the much greater ability to sustain the transverse load and the easy and effectual wire re-tensioning. Although wire slippage has been avoided with the novel system, wire material yield is still responsible for a pretension loss."

This paper describes an integrated biomechanical platform for real-time molecular or cellular assays. This platform is composed of silicon nanotweezers to manipulate the biological samples and an open microfluidic to handle solution and reactive agents. The tweezers are fabricated by standard Silicon-On-Insulator based micromachining processes (2 masks +1 additional mask for special tips) and integrate actuator, trapping tips and sensor. The microfluidic device is produced from common polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micromolding and integrates active valves for controlling the biological medium. Combining both technologies, a versatile experimental setup, built up in an enclosed space (< 10 cm(3)), enables direct interrogation of molecules or cells in solution. The silicon nanotweezers sense slight biological modifications of the trapped molecules or cell by monitoring the mechanical resonance response, which keeps a high Q factor (over 20) in liquid. Biomolecular assays (molecule trapping and enzymatic reaction kinetics) as well as characterizations of cells are reported here. The system provide molecular level resolution and is sensitive enough to capture cell biomechano-transduction activities. Moreover as the system is handy, it may be an easy, fast and quantitative alternative to existing methods. "

Molecules designed to target and accumulate in the mitochondria are an emerging therapeutic approach for cancer and other indications. Mitochondria-targeted redox agents (MTAs) induce mitochondrial damage and autophagy in cancer cells. However, the mechanisms for these molecules to induce mitophagy, the clearance of damaged mitochondria, are largely unknown. Using breast derived cell lines and a series of targeted molecules, mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagy was established to be selective for MDA-MB-231 cancer cells as compared to the non-cancerous MCF-12A cells. Kinetic analyses revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction precedes the activation of autophagy in these cancer cells. To determine the onset of mitophagy, stably expressing mitochondrial mKeima, a mitochondrial pH sensor, cell lines were generated and revealed that these drugs activate lysosomal dependent mitochondrial degradation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Mitophagy was confirmed by identifying the accumulation of a PINK1, mitochondria located in autophagosomes, and the formation of an autophagosome-mitochondria protein (MFN2-LC3-II) complex. These results are the first to demonstrate that mitochondrial redox agents selectively induce mitophagy in a breast cancer cell line and their potential application both as tools for investigating mitochondrial biomechanics and as therapeutic strategies that target mitochondrial metabolism."

It is therefore important to monitor those strains to prevent heel pressure ulcers. Using a biomechanical lower leg model, we propose to estimate the influence of the patient-specific calcaneus shape on the strains within the foot and to determine if the risk of pressure ulceration is related to the variability of this shape. The biomechanical model is discretized using a 3D Finite Element mesh representing the soft tissues, separated into four domains implementing Neo Hookean materials with different elasticities: skin, fat, Achilles' tendon, and muscles. Bones are modelled as rigid bodies attached to the tissues. Simulations show that the shape of the calcaneus has an influence on the formation of pressure ulcers with a mean variation of the maximum strain over 6.0 percentage points over 18 distinct morphologies. Furthermore, the models confirm the influence of the cushion on which the leg is resting: a softer cushion leading to lower strains, it has less chances of creating a pressure ulcer. The methodology used for patient-specific strain estimation could be used for the prevention of heel ulcer when coupled with a pressure sensor. "

MicroCT imaging techniques were applied to quantify skull bone thickness. The strain gauge results indicated that the response of the rat skull is dependent on the intensity of the incident shock wave; greater intensity shock waves cause greater deflections of the skull. The intracranial pressure (ICP) sensors indicated that the peak pressure developed within the brain was greater than the peak side-on external pressure and correlated with surface strain. The bone plates between the lambda, bregma, and midline sutures are probable regions for the greatest flexure to occur. The data provides evidence that skull flexure is a likely candidate for the development of ICP gradients within the rat brain. This dependency of transmitted stress on particular skull dynamics for a given species should be considered by those investigating blast-related neurotrauma using animal models."

Plant growth and morphogenesis are tightly controlled processes of division and expansion of individual cells. To fully describe the factors that influence cell expansion, it is necessary to quantify the counteracting forces of turgor pressure and cell wall stiffness, which together determine whether and how a cell expands. Several methods have been developed to measure these parameters, but most of them provide only values for one or the other, and thus require complex models to derive the missing quantity. Furthermore, available methods for turgor measurement are either accurate but invasive, like the pressure probe; or they lack accuracy, such as incipient plasmolysis or indentation-based methods that rely on information about the mechanical properties of the cell wall. Here, we describe a system that overcomes many of the above-mentioned disadvantages using growing pollen tubes of Lilium longiflorum as a model. By combining non-invasive microindentation and cell compression experiments, we separately measure turgor pressure and cell wall elasticity on the same pollen tube in parallel. Due to the modularity of the setup and the large range of the micro-positioning system, our method is not limited to pollen tubes but could be used to investigate the biomechanical properties of many other cell types or tissues."

In this study, a methodological approach was developed merging 2D video recordings with sensor-based motion capture to investigate ski jump landings. A reference measurement was carried out in a laboratory, and subsequently, the method was exemplified in a field study by assessing the effect of a ski boot modification on landing kinematics. Landings of four expert skiers were filmed under field conditions in the jump plane, and full body kinematics were measured with an inertial motion unit (IMU) -based motion capture suit. This exemplary study revealed that the combination of video and IMU data is viable. However, only one skier was able to make use of the added boot flexibility, likely due to an extended training time with the modified boot. In this case, maximum knee flexion changed by 36° and maximum ankle flexion by 13°, whereas the other three skiers changed only marginally. The results confirm that 2D video merged with IMU data are suitable for jump analyses in winter sports, and that the modified boot will allow for alterations in landing technique provided that enough time for training is given."

The literature pertinent to adding lameness detection to accelerometers is reviewed in this paper. Options for lameness detection systems are examined including the choice of sensor, raw data collected, variables extracted, and statistical classification methods used. Two categories of variables derived from accelerometer-based systems are examined. These categories are behavior measures such as lying and measures of gait. For example, one measure of gait is the time a leg is swinging during a gait cycle. Some behavior-focused studies have reported accuracy levels of greater than 80%. Cow gait measures have been investigated to a lesser extent than behavior. However, classification accuracies as high as 91% using gait measures have been reported with hardware likely to be practical for commercial farms.

The methodology was developed from testing a human cadaver lumbar spine column. Acoustic sensors were glued to all vertebrae, high-rate impact loading was applied, load-time histories were recorded (load cell), and fracture was documented using CT. Compression fracture occurred to L1 while other vertebrae were intact. FFT of raw voltage-time traces were used to determine an optimum frequency range associated with high decibel levels.

Bursting time was associated with time of fracture initiation. Force at fracture was determined using this time and force-time data. The methodology is independent of selecting parameters a priori such as fixing a voltage level(s), bandpass frequency and/or using force-time signal, and allows determination of force based on time identified during signal processing.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the chestband-based deflection responses from these tests. <b>Methods:</b> The 3-point belt-restrained 50th percentile male THOR dummy was seated upright in a buck consisting of a rigid flat seat, simulated center console, dashboard, far-side side door structure, and armrest. It was designed to conduct pure lateral and oblique impacts. The center console, dashboard, simulated door structure, and armrest were covered with energy-absorbing materials. A center-mounted airbag was mounted to the right side of the seat. Two 59-gage chestbands were routed on the circumference of the thorax, with the upper and lower chestbands at the level of the third and sixth ribs, respectively, following the rib geometry. Oblique and pure lateral far-side impact tests with and without airbags were conducted at 8.3 m/s. Maximum chest deflections were computed by processing temporal contours using custom software and 3 methods: Procedures paralleling human cadaver studies, using the actual anchor point location and actual alignment of the InfraRed Telescoping Rods for the Assessment of Chest Compression (IR-TRACC) in the dummy on each aspect-that is, right or left,-and using the same anchor location of the internal sensor but determining the location of the peak chest deflection on the contour confined to the aspect of the sensor; these were termed the SD, ID, and TD metrics, respectively. <b>Results:</b> All deformation contours at the upper and lower thorax levels and associated peak deflections are given for all tests. Briefly, the ID metrics were the lowest in magnitude for both pure lateral and oblique modes, regardless of the presence or absence of an airbag. This was followed by the TD metric, and the SD metric produced the greatest deflections. <b>Conclusion:</b> The chestbands provide a unique opportunity to compute peak deflections that parallel current IR-TRACC-type deflections and allow computation of peak deflections independent of the initial point of attachment to the rib. The differing locations of the peak deflection vectors along the rib contours for different test conditions suggest that a priori attachment is less effective. Further, varying magnitudes of the differences between ID and TD metrics underscore the difficulty in extrapolating ID outputs under different conditions: Pure lateral versus oblique, airbag presence, and thoracic levels. Deflection measurements should, therefore, not be limited to an instrument that can only track from a fixed point. For improved predictions, these results suggest the need to investigate alternative techniques, such as optical methods to improve chest deflection measurements for far-side occupant injury assessment and mitigation."

Abduction braces are used with the intention of relieving tension on the supraspinatus, thereby protecting an operative repair. It is not known, however, whether patients wearing a brace do deposit the weight of the arm on the brace effectively or actively stabilize the arm despite the brace. It is further unknown what position of the arm is most effective to relax the shoulder and is considered most comfortable. Twenty-two patients who had undergone an arthroscopic supraspinatus repair were postoperatively fitted with a standard abduction brace equipped with a torque sensor to measure the weight of the arm on the brace on the first and second postoperative days. The most comfortable arm position, tear size, and degenerative muscular changes on magnetic resonance imaging were assessed. Most patients (15 vs 5) preferred a low angle of abduction with the brace in the scapular rather than the true frontal plane irrespective of tear location or size. While loads applied to the brace were slightly higher at high abduction angles (70° and 90°) under regional anesthesia (day 1), they were significantly higher at low abduction angles (30° and 50°) with the arm fully awake (day 2). The most comfortable brace position-which is at low angles of abduction (30° to 50°) in the scapular plane-is associated with the highest load transfer to the brace in the unanesthetized arm. The authors therefore conclude that if an abduction brace is used, it should be fitted in the scapular plane with an abduction angle between 30° and 50°. [Orthopedics. 2021;44(x):xx-xx.]."

Molecular dynamics and intracellular morphogenesis are easier to study in cell culture than in tissues. However, cultured cells are usually nonciliated and the empirical methods that are used to induce ciliogenesis in these cells have variable efficiencies.

Here, we describe a method to induce and modulate ciliogenesis in mammalian cells in culture that is compatible with high-throughput imaging and analysis. Surface micropatterning is used to normalize cell shape and actin network architecture. In these conditions, the deprivation of growth factor induces ciliogenesis in individual single cells. The manipulation of cell-spreading area is used to modulate the proportion of ciliated cells. The manipulation of cell adhesion geometry is used to orient the position of the primary cilium.

Monitoring tooth mobility and changes of the material properties of the PDL might help in early diagnosis of periodontal diseases and improve their prognosis. It was the aim of this study to develop a novel intraoral device to determine the biomechanical characteristics of the periodontal ligament. This includes the measurement of applied forces and resulting tooth displacement in order to investigate the biomechanical behaviour of the periodontium with varying loading protocols with respect to velocity and tooth displacement. The developed device uses a piezoelectric actuator to apply a displacement to a tooth's crown, and the resulting force is measured by an integrated force sensor. To measure the tooth displacement independently and non-invasively, two magnets are fixed on the teeth. The change in the magnetic field caused by the movement of the magnets is measured by a total of 16 Hall sensors. The displacement of the tooth is calculated from the movement of the magnets. The device was tested in vitro on premolars of four porcine mandibular segments and in vivo on two volunteers. The teeth were loaded with varying activation curves. Comparing the force progression of different activation velocities, the forces decreased with decreasing velocity. Intensive testing demonstrated that the device fulfils all requirements.

Over the past decades, considerable developments in skiing techniques and improvements in equipment and track preparation have increased skiing speed. In contrast to the numerous investigations on the physiological determinants of successful performance, key biomechanical factors have been less explored. Today's XC skier must master a wide range of speeds, terrains, and race distances and formats (e.g., distance races with individual start, mass-start or pursuit; knock-out and team-sprint; relays), continuously adapting by alternating between various sub-techniques.

Despite the research on opportunities to automatically measure lameness in cattle, lameness detection systems are not widely available commercially and are only used on a few dairy farms. However, farmers need to be aware of the lame cows in their herds in order treat them properly and in a timely fashion. Many papers have focused on the automated measurement of gait or behavioral cow characteristics related to lameness. In order for such automated measurements to be used in a detection system, algorithms to distinguish between non-lame and mildly or severely lame cows need to be developed and validated. Few studies have reached this latter stage of the development process. Also, comparison between the different approaches is impeded by the wide range of practical settings used to measure the gait or behavioral characteristic (e.g., measurements during normal farming routine or during experiments; cows guided or walking at their own speed) and by the different definitions of lame cows. In the majority of the publications, mildly lame cows are included in the non-lame cow group, which limits the possibility of also detecting early lameness cases. In this review, studies that used sensor technology to measure changes in gait or behavior of cows related to lameness are discussed together with practical considerations when conducting lameness research. In addition, other prerequisites for any lameness detection system on farms (e.g., need for early detection, real-time measurements) are discussed. "

Smartphone-sensors-based human activity recognition is attracting increasing interest due to the popularization of smartphones. It is a difficult long-range temporal recognition problem, especially with large intraclass distances such as carrying smartphones at different locations and small interclass distances such as taking a train or subway. To address this problem, we propose a new framework of combining short-term spatial/frequency feature extraction and a long-term independently recurrent neural network (IndRNN) for activity recognition. Considering the periodic characteristics of the sensor data, short-term temporal features are first extracted in the spatial and frequency domains. Then, the IndRNN, which can capture long-term patterns, is used to further obtain the long-term features for classification. Given the large differences when the smartphone is carried at different locations, a group-based location recognition is first developed to pinpoint the location of the smartphone. The Sussex-Huawei Locomotion (SHL) dataset from the SHL Challenge is used for evaluation. An earlier version of the proposed method won the second place award in the SHL Challenge 2020 (first place if not considering the multiple models fusion approach). The proposed method is further improved in this paper and achieves 80.72% accuracy, better than the existing methods using a single model."

Mounting evidence has shown that vestibular self-motion signals interact with visual motion processing profoundly. However, most contemporary methods arguably lack portability and generality and are incapable of providing measurements during locomotion. Here we developed a virtual reality approach, combining a three-space sensor with a head-mounted display, to quantitatively manipulate the causality between retinal motion and head rotations in the yaw plane. Using this system, we explored how self-motion affected visual motion perception, particularly the motion aftereffect (MAE). Subjects watched gratings presented on a head-mounted display. The gratings drifted at the same velocity as head rotations, with the drifting direction being identical, opposite, or perpendicular to the direction of head rotations. We found that MAE lasted a significantly shorter time when subjects' heads rotated than when their heads were kept still. This effect was present regardless of the drifting direction of the gratings, and was also observed during passive head rotations. These findings suggest that the adaptation to retinal motion is suppressed by head rotations. Because the suppression was also found during passive head movements, it should result from visual-vestibular interaction rather than from efference copy signals. Such visual-vestibular interaction is more flexible than has previously been thought, since the suppression could be observed even when the retinal motion direction was perpendicular to head rotations. Our work suggests that a virtual reality approach can be applied to various studies of multisensory integration and interaction."

We compared brain pressure at the coup, middle, and contre-coup regions between a 2D rat head model capable of simulating all mechanisms (i.e., the all-effects model) and an acceleration-only model. From our simulations, we determined that head acceleration contributed 36-45% of the maximum brain pressure at the coup region, had a negligible effect on the pressure at the middle region, and was responsible for the low pressure at the contre-coup region. Our findings also demonstrate that the current practice of measuring rat brain pressures close to the center of the brain would record only two-thirds of the maximum pressure observed at the coup region.

Eight male and four female healthy subjects followed an original paradigm of phrenic nerve stimulation (bilateral and unilateral) and ""diaphragmatic"" voluntary sniff maneuvers in the seated and standing postures. Center of gravity (CG) acceleration was calculated from force plate recordings, and respiratory kinematics were assessed with thoracic and abdominal sensor belts. CG and respiratory signals revealed that, while seated, bilateral phrenic stimulation and sniff maneuvers consistently produced expansion of the abdomen associated with a forward peak of CG acceleration. In the standing posture, the direction of the CG peak was reversed and always directed backward. Unilateral phrenic stimulation induced an additional medial-lateral acceleration of the CG, directed toward the nonactive side while seated, but in the opposite direction while standing. These results suggest that isolated diaphragmatic contractions produce a constant disturbing pattern for a given posture, but with opposite effects between standing and seated postures. This could be related to the different biomechanical configuration of the body in each posture, corresponding to distinct kinematic patterns of the osteoarticular chain. In addition, the lateral component of the CG acceleration induced by unilateral diaphragm contractions could be clinically relevant in patients with hemidiaphragm paralysis. "

Our results show that reflex circuits can be self-organized from SMA, and that, once these circuits are in place, they can be modulated to achieve coordinated behaviour. In addition, our results show that our model can naturally adapt to different morphological changes and perform behavioural transitions. "

A strain-sensing lyriform organ (HS-10) found on all of the legs of a Central American wandering spider (Cupiennius salei) detects courtship, prey and predator vibrations transmitted by the plant on which it sits. It has been suggested that the viscoelastic properties of a cuticular pad directly adjacent to the sensory organ contribute to the organ's pronounced high-pass characteristics. Here, we investigate the micromechanical properties of the cuticular pad biomaterial in search of a deeper understanding of its impact on the function of the vibration sensor. These properties are considered to be an effective adaptation for the selective detection of signals for frequencies >40 Hz. Using surface force spectroscopy mapping we determine the elastic modulus of the pad surface over a temperature range of 15-40 °C at various loading frequencies. In the glassy state, the elastic modulus was ~100 MPa, while in the rubbery state the elastic modulus decreased to 20 MPa. These data are analyzed according to the principle of time-temperature superposition to construct a master curve that relates mechanical properties, temperature and stimulus frequencies. By estimating the loss and storage moduli vs. temperature and frequency it was possible to make a direct comparison with electrophysiology experiments, and it was found that the dissipation of energy occurs within a frequency window whose position is controlled by environmental temperatures."

Although personal protective equipment (PPE), including soft and hard body armor, mitigates penetrating injuries from ballistic threats, the impact generates a backface deformation which creates a high-rate blunt impact to the body and potential internal injury (i.e., BABT). A critical need exists to understand the mechanics of the human response and subsequently evaluate the efficacy of current and proposed PPE in mitigating BABT injury risk. Current human surrogate test platforms lack anatomical fidelity or instrumentation for capturing the dynamic transfer of energy during the event. Therefore, we have developed and tested a Human Surrogate Torso Model (HSTM) composed of biosimulants representing soft tissues and skeleton of the human torso. A matrix of pressure transducers were embedded in the soft tissue and a custom displacement sensor was mounted to the skeletal structure to measure sternum displacement. A series of non-penetrating, high energy ballistic tests were performed with the HSTM. Results indicate that both sternum displacement and internal localized pressure are sensitive to impact energy and location.

People with disabilities encounter many difficulties, especially when a diagnosis of more than one dysfunction is made, as is the case for visually impaired wheelchair users. In fact, this scenario generates a degree of incapacity in terms of the performance of basic activities on the part of the wheelchair user. The treatment of disabled patients is performed in an individualized manner according to their particular clinical aspects. People with visual and motor disabilities are restricted in independent navigation. In this navigation scenario, there is a requirement for interaction that justifies the use of virtual reality (VR). In addition, locomotion needs to be under natural control to be successfully incorporated. Based on such a condition, electroencephalography (EEG) has shown great advances in the area of health by employing spontaneous brain signals. This research demonstrates, through an experiment, the use of a wheelchair adapted to have the support of VR and EEG for training of locomotion and individualized interaction of wheelchair users with visual impairment. The objective was to provide efficient interactions, thus allowing the social inclusion of patients who are considered otherwise incapacitated. This project was based on the following criteria: natural control, feedback, stimuli, and safety. A multilayer computer rehabilitation system was developed that incorporated natural interaction supported by EEG, which activated the movements in the virtual environment and real wheelchair through adequately performed experiments.

The role of PDF outside of the clock circuit, however, is poorly understood. A recent study suggested that PDF may act on the ellipsoid body (EB) to link the clock and sleep/activity circuits. We performed whole brain optical imaging with the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based cAMP sensor Epac1-camps expressed under control of the pdfR promoter to address how the clock and sleep deprivation affect the physiology of these cells. Basal cAMP levels in EB were regulated both by PDF and synaptic inputs that are controlled by the circadian clock. Acute application of PDF to the brain caused a significant, and PDF-receptor-dependent, increase in cAMP in EB cells. Application of TTX to block circuit-mediated effects of PDF increased the morning response but not the response at night, implying the existence of a temporally regulated, PDF-stimulated input that blocks cAMP generation. ACh produced both direct (TTX-insensitive) and indirect (TTX-sensitive) increases in cAMP during the day but was totally TTX-insensitive at night, indicating that ACh-stimulated inputs to the EB are suppressed at night. Sleep deprivation did not affect the cAMP responses of these cells to either PDF or ACh. These results suggest a novel role for PDF as a modulator of activity outside of the clock circuit. By elucidating the mechanisms by which the neuropeptide PDF act on its target cells, our work contributes to our understating of how the central clock coordinates activity and sleep. "

Fundamental scaling relationships influence the physiology of vital rates, which in turn shape the ecology and evolution of organisms. For diving mammals, benefits conferred by large body size include reduced transport costs and enhanced breath-holding capacity, thereby increasing overall foraging efficiency. Rorqual whales feed by engulfing a large mass of prey-laden water at high speed and filtering it through baleen plates. However, as engulfment capacity increases with body length (engulfment volume∝body length<sup>3.57</sup>), the surface area of the baleen filter does not increase proportionally (baleen area∝body length<sup>1.82</sup>), and thus the filtration time of larger rorquals predictably increases as the baleen surface area must filter a disproportionally large amount of water. We predicted that filtration time should scale with body length to the power of 1.75 (filter time∝body length<sup>1.75</sup>). We tested this hypothesis on four rorqual species using multi-sensor tags with corresponding unoccupied aircraft systems-based body length estimates. We found that filter time scales with body length to the power of 1.79 (95% CI: 1.61-1.97). This result highlights a scale-dependent trade-off between engulfment capacity and baleen area that creates a biomechanical constraint to foraging through increased filtration time.

If these optimal patches are absent, larger rorquals may experience reduced foraging efficiency compared with smaller whales if they do not match their engulfment capacity to the size of targeted prey aggregations."

For survival of the organism, acid-base homeostasis is vital [1, 2]. The respiratory and renal systems are central to this control. Here we describe a novel mechanism, intrinsic to the spinal cord, with sensors that detect pH changes and act to restore pH to physiological levels by reducing motor activity. This pH sensor consists of somatostatin-expressing cerebrospinal fluid-contacting (CSF-c) neurons, which target the locomotor network. They have a low level of activity at pH 7.4. However, at both alkaline and acidic pH, the activity of the individual CSF-c neuron is markedly enhanced through the action of two separate channel subtypes. The alkaline response depends on PKD2L1 channels that have a large conductance and an equilibrium potential around 0 mV, both characteristics of mouse PKD2L1 channels [3-5]. The acidic response is due to an activation of ASIC3 [6]. The discharge pattern of the CSF-c neurons is U-shaped with a minimum frequency around pH 7.4 and a marked increase already at slightly lower and higher pH. During ongoing locomotor activity in the isolated spinal cord, both an increase and as a decrease of pH will reduce the locomotor burst rate. A somatostatin antagonist blocks these effects, suggesting that CSF-c neurons are responsible for the suppression of locomotor activity. CSF-c neurons thus represent a novel innate homeostatic mechanism, designed to sense any deviation from physiological pH and to respond by causing a depression of the motor activity. Because CSF-c neurons are found in all vertebrates, their pH-sensing function is most likely conserved."

Ten human cadaveric knees were used (20 condyles). Contact pressure was measured with Tekscan sensor technology (South Boston, Massachusetts) with both static and cyclical loads (of 250 and 500 cycles) created by an MTS Bionix system (Eden Prairie, Minnesota) under the following conditions: native articular cartilage, surgically created defect (7-mm diameter), 1-mm proud osteochondral autograft, and 1-mm proud synthetic graft. Proud osteochondral autograft plugs resulted in a 21.4% increase in peak contact pressure over surrounding native articular cartilage versus a 4.9% increase with proud synthetic plugs. Synthetic plugs compressed their structure and subsided versus subchondral bone collapse with compressive load in osteochondral autograft plugs. Proud osteochondral autograft plugs have significantly higher peak contact pressures than proud synthetic plugs when placed for treatment of chondral and osteochondral defects in the knee."

We examined the phenotypic consequences of reduced AMPK function, both through RNAi knockdown of the gamma subunit (AMPKγ) and through expression of a dominant negative alpha (AMPKα) variant in Drosophila melanogaster. Reduced AMPK signaling leads to hypersensitivity to starvation conditions as measured by lifespan and locomotor activity. Locomotor levels in flies with reduced AMPK function were lower during unstressed conditions, but starvation-induced hyperactivity, an adaptive response to encourage foraging, was significantly higher than in wild type. Unexpectedly, total dietary intake was greater in animals with reduced AMPK function yet total triglyceride levels were lower. AMPK mutant animals displayed starvation-like lipid accumulation patterns in metabolically key liver-like cells, oenocytes, even under fed conditions, consistent with a persistent starved state. Measurements of O(2) consumption reveal that metabolic rates are greater in animals with reduced AMPK function. Lastly, rapamycin treatment tempers the starvation sensitivity and lethality associated with reduced AMPK function. Collectively, these results are consistent with models that AMPK shifts energy usage away from expenditures into a conservation mode during nutrient-limited conditions at a cellular level.

Activity recognition in smart environments is an evolving research problem due to the advancement and proliferation of sensing, monitoring and actuation technologies to make it possible for large scale and real deployment.

A key challenge in designing robust smart home activity recognition approaches is to exploit the users' spatiotemporal behavior and location, focus on the availability of multitude of devices capable of providing different dimensions of information and fulfill the underpinning needs for scaling the system beyond a single user or a home environment. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for recognizing complex activities of daily living (ADL), that lie in between the two extremes of intensive use of body-worn sensors and the use of ambient sensors. Our approach harnesses the power of simple ambient sensors (e.g., motion sensors) to provide additional 'hidden' context (e.g., room-level location) of an individual, and then combines this context with smartphone-based sensing of micro-level postural/locomotive states. The major novelty is our focus on multi-inhabitant environments, where we show how the use of spatiotemporal constraints along with multitude of data sources can be used to significantly improve the accuracy and computational overhead of traditional activity recognition based approaches such as coupled-hidden Markov models. Experimental results on two separate smart home datasets demonstrate that this approach improves the accuracy of complex ADL classification by over 30 %, compared to pure smartphone-based solutions."

Its operation is based on virtual rotations of wireless sensors worn by the user, and it focuses on the arm, whose position is measured on 5 degree of freedom (DOF). The wireless sensors use inertial magnetic units that measure the alignment of the arm with the earth's gravity and magnetic fields. Due to the biomechanical properties of human tissue (e.g., skin's elasticity), the sensors' orientation is shifted, and this shift affects the accuracy of measurements. In the proposed technique, the change of orientation is first modeled from linear regressions of data collected from 15 participants at different arm positions.

The metabolic energy that human walking requires can vary by more than 10-fold, depending on the speed, surface gradient, and load carried. Although the mechanical factors determining economy are generally considered to be numerous and complex, we tested a minimum mechanics hypothesis that only three variables are needed for broad, accurate prediction: speed, surface grade, and total gravitational load. We first measured steady-state rates of oxygen uptake in 20 healthy adult subjects during unloaded treadmill trials from 0.4 to 1.6 m/s on six gradients: -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, and 9°. Next, we tested a second set of 20 subjects under three torso-loading conditions (no-load, +18, and +31% body weight) at speeds from 0.6 to 1.4 m/s on the same six gradients.

The combination of biomechanics and inertial pedestrian navigation research provides a very promising approach for pedestrian positioning in environments where Global Positioning System (GPS) signal is unavailable. However, in practical applications such as fire rescue and indoor security, the inertial sensor-based pedestrian navigation system is facing various challenges, especially the step length estimation errors and heading drift in running and sprint. In this paper, a trinal-node, including two thigh-worn inertial measurement units (IMU) and one waist-worn IMU, based simultaneous localization and occupation grid mapping method is proposed. Specifically, the gait detection and segmentation are realized by the zero-crossing detection of the difference of thighs pitch angle. A piecewise function between the step length and the probability distribution of waist horizontal acceleration is established to achieve accurate step length estimation both in regular walking and drastic motions. In addition, the simultaneous localization and mapping method based on occupancy grids, which involves the historic trajectory to improve the pedestrian's pose estimation is introduced. The experiments show that the proposed trinal-node pedestrian inertial odometer can identify and segment each gait cycle in the walking, running, and sprint. The average step length estimation error is no more than 3.58% of the total travel distance in the motion speed from 1.23 m/s to 3.92 m/s. In combination with the proposed simultaneous localization and mapping method based on the occupancy grid, the localization error is less than 5 m in a single-story building of 2643.2 m2."

Analyses of visual evoked potential (VEP) and temporal spectral evolution (TSE, time-dependent amplitude changes) were performed on EEG data recorded with a 128-channel sensor array. VEP results showed infants to significantly differentiate between the radial motion conditions, but only at 11-12 months where they showed shortest latency for forwards optic flow and longest latency for random visual motion. When the TSE results of the motion conditions were compared with those of a static non-flow dot pattern, infants at 3-4 and 11-12 months both showed significant differences in induced activity. A decrease in amplitudes at 5-7 Hz was observed as desynchronized theta-band activity at both 3-4 and 11-12 months, while an increase in amplitudes at 9-13 Hz was observed as synchronized alpha-band activity only at 11-12 months. It was concluded that brain electrical activities related to visual motion perception change during the first year of life, and these changes can be observed both in the VEP and induced activities of EEG. With adequate neurobiological development and locomotor experience infants around 1 year of age rely, more so than when they were younger, on structured optic flow and show a more adult-like specialization for motion where faster oscillating cell assemblies have fewer but more specialized neurons, resulting in improved visual motion perception."

The predefined displacement values to be achieved were 0.1 and 0.2 mm. Each of the given displacement increments was applied on the specimens with a linear displacement increase employing the following time spans: 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 300, 450, and 600 seconds. Force values were measured during load application to register force/displacement diagrams and after the maximum displacement was reached force decay was monitored for a period of 600 seconds. Force/time curves for each tooth were plotted according to the data obtained. Diagrams of the maximum force values obtained from these plots and the force at the end of each measurement were extracted for all teeth. Forces at the point when maximum displacement was reached ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 N for the 0.1 mm activation and showed extreme variation with the specimens. The factor of volume and surface area of the individual roots were evaluated and found not to be responsible for these deviations. A comparable behaviour was recorded for the 0.2 mm deflection, however, on a higher force level. The results show that the force development at different displacement velocities is complex and dominated by the PDL biomechanical characteristics. "

Solid-fluid interactions play an important role in mediating viscoelastic behaviour of biological tissues. In the intervertebral disc, water content is governed by a number of factors, including age, disease and mechanical loads, leading to changes in stiffness characteristics. We hypothesized that zonal stress distributions depend on load history, or the prior stresses experienced by the disc. To investigate these effects, rat caudal motion segments were subjected to compressive creep biomechanical testing in vitro using a protocol that consisted of two phases: a Prestress Phase (varied to represent different histories of load) followed immediately by an Exertion Phase, identical across all Prestress groups. Three analytical models were used to fit the experimental data in order to evaluate load history effects on gross and zonal disc mechanics. Model results indicated that while gross transient response was insensitive to load history, there may be changes in the internal mechanics of the disc. In particular, a fluid transport model suggested that the role of the nucleus pulposus in resisting creep during Exertion depended on Prestress conditions. Separate experiments using similarly defined load history regimens were performed to verify these predictions by measuring intradiscal pressure with a fibre optic sensor. We found that the ability for intradiscal pressure generation was load history-dependent and exhibited even greater sensitivity than predicted by analytical models. A 0.5 MPa Exertion load resulted in 537.2 kPa IDP for low magnitude Prestress compared with 373.7 kPa for high magnitude Prestress.

This paper presents a microfluidic-based impedance sensor with on-chip oxygen control for the dielectric characterization of sickle cells. A complete dielectric characterization of sickle cells under both normoxia and hypoxia within the frequency range of 40 Hz to 110 MHz is achieved within ∼7 min based on ∼2.5 μL sample. Analysis of the sensing modeling is performed to obtain optimum conditions for dielectric spectroscopy of cell suspensions and for extraction of single cell properties from the measured impedance spectra. The results of sickle cells show that upon hypoxia treatment, cell interior permittivity and conductivity increase, while cell membrane capacitance decreases. Moreover, the relative changes in cell dielectric properties are found to be highly dependent on the sickle and fetal hemoglobin levels. In contrast, the changes in normal red blood cells between the hypoxia and normoxia states are unnoticeable. The results of sickle cells may serve as a reference to design dielectrophoresis-based cell sorting and biomechanical testing devices that require cell dielectric characteristics as input parameters.

Quantifying lumbar back motion during functional activities in real-life environments may contribute to a better understanding of common pathologies such as spinal disorders. The current study therefore aimed at the comparative evaluation of the Epionics SPINE system, a portable device for measuring sagittal lumbar back motion during functional activities. Twenty healthy participants were therefore evaluated with the Epionics SPINE and a Vicon motion capture system in two identical separate research visits. They performed the following activities: standing, sitting, chair rising, box lifting, walking, running and a counter movement jump (CMJ). Lumbar lordosis angles were extracted as continuous values as well as average and range of motion (ROM) parameters. Agreement between the systems was evaluated using Bland-Altman analyses, whereas within- and between-session reliability were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and minimal detectable changes (MDC). The analysis showed excellent agreement between the systems for chair rising, box lifting and CMJ with a systematic underestimation of lumbar lordosis angles during walking and running. Reliability was moderate to high for all continuous and discrete parameters (ICC ≥ 0.62), except for ROM during running (ICC = 0.29). MDC values were generally below 15°, except for CMJ (peak values up to 20° within and 25° between the sessions). The Epionics SPINE system performed similarly to a Vicon motion capture system for measuring lumbar lordosis angles during functional activities and showed high consistency within and between measurement sessions. These findings can serve researchers and clinicians as a bench mark for future investigations using the system in populations with spinal pathologies."

Our objectives were to document thoracolumbar movement in subjectively sound horses comparing straight lines with circles on both reins and to relate these observations to the objectively determined symmetry/asymmetry of hindlimb gait. Fourteen non-lame horses were assessed prospectively in a non-random, cross-sectional survey.

The dorsoventral movement of the back exhibited a sinusoidal pattern with two oscillations per stride. Circles induced greater asymmetry in dorsoventral movement within each stride (mean ± standard deviation, up to 9 ± 6%) compared with straight lines (up to 6 ± 6%). The greatest amplitude of dorsoventral movement (119 ± 14 mm in straight lines vs. 126 ± 20 mm in circles) occurred at T13.

Here we propose to combine nanocharacterisation tools, particularly Focused Ion Beam (FIB) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) for three dimensional mapping of mechanical modulus and chemical signatures. The prototype platform is applied to image and investigate the fundamental mechanics of the rat face whiskers, a high-acuity sensor used to gain detailed information about the world. Grazing angle FIB milling was first applied to expose the interior cross section of the rat whisker sample, followed by a ""lift-out"" method to retrieve and position the target sample for further analyses. AFM force spectroscopy measurements revealed a non-uniform pattern of elastic modulus across the cross section, with a range from 0.8GPa to 13.5GPa. The highest elastic modulus was found at the outer cuticle region of the whisker, and values gradually decreased towards the interior cortex and medulla regions. Elemental mapping with EDS confirmed that the interior of the rat whisker is dominated by C, O, N, S, Cl and K, with a significant change of elemental distribution close to the exterior cuticle region. Based on these data, a novel comprehensive three dimensional (3D) elastic modulus model was constructed, and stress distributions under realistic conditions were investigated with Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The simulations could well account for the passive whisker deflections, with calculated resonant frequency as well as force-deflection for the whiskers being in good agreement with reported experimental data. Limitations and further applications are discussed for the proposed FIB/AFM approach, which holds good promise as a unique platform to gain insights on various heterogeneous biomaterials and biomechanical systems."

BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the biomechanical fixation effects of different segments of the goat spine on adjacent segmental motion and intradiscal pressure (IDP) change. MATERIAL AND METHODS Eighteen goat spine specimens were randomly divided into 3 groups: group A (single-segment fixation), group B (double-segment fixation), and group C (triple-segment fixation). The motion was tested on each specimen using a spinal motion simulation test system with rational pressure loading. The IDP was measured using a pinhole pressure sensor. RESULTS Range of motion (ROM) and IDP of adjacent segments increased with increased external load. In comparison of the 3 groups, significant differences in ROM were found when the external force was more than 100 N (P<0.05). The differences in IDP of the adjacent segment were statistically significant (P<0.05) when external pressure was greater than or equal to 60 N. However, in comparison of group A with group B, no significant differences in ROM and IDP of the adjacent segments were noted for the motions of anterior flexion, posterior extension, and lateral bending (P>0.05). Moreover, upper adjacent segments had greater ROM than the lower adjacent segments (P<0.05). We found significant differences between IDPs of the upper adjacent segments and lower adjacent segments (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS As the number of fixated lumbar segments increases, ROM and IDP of the adjacent segments increase. Multisegment fixation is most likely the main factor contributing to the development of adjacent segmental lesions after lumbar fixation."

However, the literature describing how they are transmitted from the pelvis to the head is lacking. This study proposes a multilevel motion sensor approach to characterize upper body accelerations and how they propagate from pelvis to head in children with CP, comparing with their TD peers. Two age- and gender-matched groups of 20 children performed a 10m walking test at self-selected speed while wearing three magneto-inertial sensors located at pelvis, sternum, and head levels. The root mean square value of the accelerations at each level was computed in a local anatomical frame and its variation from lower to upper levels was described using attenuation coefficients. Between-group differences were assessed performing an ANCOVA, while the mutual dependence between acceleration components and the relationship between biomechanical parameters and typical clinical scores were investigated using Regression Analysis and Spearman's Correlation, respectively (α = 0.05). New insights were obtained on how the CP group managed the transmission of accelerations through the upper body. Despite a significant reduction of the acceleration from pelvis to sternum, children with CP do not compensate for large accelerations, which are greater than in TD children. Furthermore, those with CP showed negative sternum-to-head attenuations, in agreement with the documented rigidity of the head-trunk system observed in this population. In addition, the estimated parameters proved to correlate with the scores used in daily clinical practice. The proposed multilevel approach was fruitful in highlighting CP-TD gait differences, supported the in-field quantitative gait assessment in children with CP and might prove beneficial to designing innovative intervention protocols based on pelvis stabilization.

In this paper, a novel fast technique is presented for the estimation of the sway angle in a multi-link chain by using a single-axis accelerometer per segment and by setting the boundary conditions through an ad hoc algorithm. The technique, based on the windowing of the accelerometer output, was firstly tested on a mechanical arm equipped with a single-axis accelerometer and a reference encoder.

The moderate peak pressure experienced by the palmigrade hand with total-hand contact was due to increased contact area under the palm. The total contact area of the fingers and peak GRF to the fingers were relatively unchanged with different patterns of hand contact.

A combined experimental and numerical study was conducted to determine a method to elucidate the biomechanical response of a head surrogate physical model under air shock loading. In the physical experiments, a gel-filled egg-shaped skull/brain surrogate was exposed to blast overpressure in a shock tube environment, and static pressures within the shock tube and the surrogate were recorded throughout the event. A numerical model of the shock tube was developed using the Eulerian approach and validated against experimental data. An arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) fluid-structure coupling algorithm was then utilized to simulate the interaction of the shock wave and the head surrogate. After model validation, a comprehensive series of parametric studies was carried out on the egg-shaped surrogate FE model to assess the effect of several key factors, such as the elastic modulus of the shell, bulk modulus of the core, head orientation, and internal sensor location, on pressure and strain responses. Results indicate that increasing the elastic modulus of the shell within the range simulated in this study led to considerable rise of the overpressures. Varying the bulk modulus of the core from 0.5 to 2.0 GPa, the overpressure had an increase of 7.2%. The curvature of the surface facing the shock wave significantly affected both the peak positive and negative pressures. Simulations of the head surrogate with the blunt end facing the advancing shock front had a higher pressure compared to the simulations with the pointed end facing the shock front. The influence of an opening (possibly mimicking anatomical apertures) on the peak pressures was evaluated using a surrogate head with a hole on the shell of the blunt end.

The purpose of this study was to ascertain the relationships between the amplitude of the corneal pulse (CP) signal and the parameters of corneal biomechanics during ex-vivo intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation experiments on porcine eyes with artificially induced ocular pulse cycles. Two experiments were carried out using porcine eyes. In the first one, a selected eye globe was subjected to three IOP levels (15, 30 and 45 mmHg), where changes in physical ocular pulse amplitude were controlled by infusion/withdrawal volumes (ΔV). In the second experiment, six eyes were subjected to IOP from 15 mmHg to 45 mmHg in steps of 5 mmHg with a constant ΔV, where corneal deformation parameters were measured using Corvis ST. In both experiments, at each IOP, the CP and IOP signals were acquired synchronically using a non-contact ultrasonic distance sensor and a pressure transmitter, respectively. Based on the amplitudes of the CP and IOP signals ocular pulse based corneal rigidity index (OPCRI) was calculated. Results indicate positive correlations between ΔV and the physical ocular pulse amplitude, and between ΔV and the corneal pulse amplitude (both p < 0.001). OPCRI was found to increase with elevated IOP. Furthermore, IOP statistically significantly differentiated changes in OPCRI, the amplitudes of CP and IOP signals and in most of the corneal deformation parameters (p < 0.05). The partial correlation analysis, with IOP as a control variable, revealed a significant correlation between the length of the flattened cornea during the first applanation (A1L) and the corneal pulse amplitude (p = 0.002), and between A1L and OPCRI (p = 0.003). In conclusion, this study proved that natural corneal pulsations, detected with a non-contact ultrasonic technique, reflect pressure-volume dynamics and can potentially be utilized to assess stiffness of the cornea. The proposed new rigidity index could be a simple approach to estimating corneal rigidity."

Twenty-one healthy adults performed normal walking trials while being monitored using both systems. The outcome measures of gait speed, step length and time, stride length and time and peak foot swing velocity were derived using supervised automated analysis. To assess the agreement between the Kinect and 3DMA devices, Bland-Altman 95% bias and limits of agreement, percentage error, relative agreement (Pearson's correlation coefficients: r) overall agreement (concordance correlation coefficients: rc) and landmark location linearity as a function of distance from the sensor were determined. Gait speed, step length and stride length from the two devices possessed excellent agreement (r and rc values >0.90). Foot swing velocity possessed excellent relative (r=0.93) but only modest overall (rc=0.54) agreement. Step time (r=0.82 and rc=0.23) and stride time (r=0.69 and rc=0.14) possessed excellent and modest relative agreement respectively but poor overall agreement. Landmark location linearity was excellent (R(2)=0.991). This widely available, low-cost and portable system could provide clinicians with significant advantages for assessing some spatiotemporal gait parameters. However, caution must be taken when choosing outcome variables as some commonly reported variables cannot be accurately measured. "

However, no effector-interaction mutations to date impact synaptic transmission as severely as mutation of the C(2)B Ca(2+)-binding motif, suggesting that these interactions are facilitatory rather than essential. Here we use Drosophila to show the functional role of a highly conserved, hydrophobic residue located at the tip of each of the two Ca(2+)-binding pockets of synaptotagmin. Mutation of this residue in the C(2)A domain (F286) resulted in a ∼50% decrease in evoked transmitter release at an intact synapse, again indicative of a facilitatory role. Mutation of this hydrophobic residue in the C(2)B domain (I420), on the other hand, blocked all locomotion, was embryonic lethal even in syt I heterozygotes, and resulted in less evoked transmitter release than that in syt(null) mutants, which is more severe than the phenotype of C(2)B Ca(2+)-binding mutants. Thus, mutation of a single, C(2)B hydrophobic residue required for Ca(2+)-dependent penetration of anionic membranes results in the most severe disruption of synaptotagmin function in vivo to date. Our results provide direct support for the hypothesis that plasma membrane penetration, specifically by the C(2)B domain of synaptotagmin, is the critical effector interaction for coupling Ca(2+) binding with vesicle fusion."

Recently alpine skis with a wider waist width, which medially shifts the contact between the ski edge and the snow while turning, have appeared on the market. The aim of this study was to determine the knee joint kinematics during turning while using skis of different waist widths (65mm, 88mm, 110mm). Six highly skilled skiers performed ten turns on a predefined course (similar to a giant slalom course). The relation of femur and tibia in the sagital, frontal and coronal planes was captured by using an inertial motion capture suit, and Global Navigation Satellite System was used to determine the skiers' trajectories. With respect of the outer ski the knee joint flexion, internal rotation and abduction significantly decreased with the increase of the ski waist width for the greatest part of the ski turn. The greatest abduction with the narrow ski and the greatest external rotation (lowest internal rotation) with the wide ski are probably the reflection of two different strategies of coping the biomechanical requirements in the ski turn. These changes in knee kinematics were most probably due to an active adaptation of the skier to the changed biomechanical conditions using wider skis. The results indicated that using skis with large waist widths on hard, frozen surfaces could bring the knee joint unfavorably closer to the end of the range of motion in transversal and frontal planes as well as potentially increasing the risk of degenerative knee injuries. Key pointsThe change in the skis' waist width caused a change in the knee joint movement strategies, which had a tendency to adapt the skier to different biomechanical conditions.The use of wider skis or, in particular, skis with a large waist width, on a hard or frozen surface, could unfavourably bring the knee joint closer to the end of range of motion in transversal and frontal planes as well as may potentially increase the risk of degenerative knee injuries.The overall results of the abduction and internal rotation in respect to turn radii and ground reaction forces indicated that the knee joint movements are likely one of the key points in alpine skiing techniques. However, the skiing equipment used can still significantly influence the movement strategy. "

The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of hoof trimming on cow behavior (ruminating time, activity, and locomotion score) and performance (milk yield) over time. Data were gathered from a commercial dairy farm in Israel where routine hoof trimming is done by a trained hoof trimmer twice per year on the entire herd. In total, 288 cows spread over 6 groups with varying production levels were used for the analysis. Cow behavior was measured continuously with a commercial neck activity logger and a ruminating time logger (HR-Tag, SCR Engineers Ltd., Netanya, Israel). Milk yield was recorded during each milking session with a commercial milk flow sensor (Free Flow, SCR Engineers Ltd.). A trained observer assigned on the spot 5-point locomotion scores during 19 nighttime milking occasions between 22 October 2012 and 4 February 2013.

A generalized linear mixed model was used to statistically test all main and interactive effects of hoof trimming, parity, lactation stage, and hoof lesion presence on ruminating time, neck activity, milk yield, and locomotion score. The results on locomotion scores show that the proportional distribution of cows in the different locomotion score classes changes significantly after trimming. The proportion of cows with a locomotion score ≥3 increases from 14% before to 34% directly after the hoof trimming. Two months after the trimming, the number of cows with a locomotion score ≥3 reduced to 20%, which was still higher than the baseline values 2wk before the trimming. The neck activity level was significantly reduced 1d after trimming (380±6 bits/d) compared with before trimming (389±6 bits/d). Each one-unit increase in locomotion score reduced cow activity level by 4.488 bits/d. The effect of hoof trimming on ruminating time was affected by an interaction effect with parity. The effect of hoof trimming on locomotion scores was affected by an interaction effect with lactation stage and tended to be affected by interaction effects with hoof lesion presence, indicating that cows with a lesion reacted different to the trimming than cows without a lesion did. The results show that the routine hoof trimming affected dairy cow behavior and performance in this farm. "

The neuronal phenotypes of the TBC1D24G501R mutation are consistent with exacerbated oxidative stress sensitivity, which is rescued by treating TBC1D24G501R mutant animals with antioxidants N-acetylcysteine amide or α-tocopherol as indicated by restored synaptic vesicle trafficking levels and sustained behavioural activity. Our data thus show that mutations in the TLDc domain of TBC1D24 cause Rolandic-type focal motor epilepsy and exercise-induced dystonia. The humanized TBC1D24G501R fly model exhibits sustained activity and vesicle transport defects. We propose that the TBC1D24/Sky TLDc domain is a reactive oxygen species sensor mediating synaptic vesicle trafficking rates that, when dysfunctional, causes a movement disorder in patients and flies. The TLDc and TBC domain mutations' response to antioxidant treatment we observed in the animal model suggests a potential for combining antioxidant-based therapeutic approaches to TBC1D24-associated disorders with previously described lipid-altering strategies for TBC domain mutations."

The hydrostatic pressure of the nucleus pulposus represents an important parameter in the characterization of spinal biomechanics, affecting the segmental stability as well as the stress distribution across the anulus fibrosus and the endplates. For the development of experimental setups and the validation of numerical models of the spine, intradiscal pressure (IDP) values under defined boundary conditions are therefore essential. Due to the lack of data regarding the thoracic spine, the purpose of this <i>in vitro</i> study was to quantify the IDP of human thoracic spinal motion segments under pure moment loading. Thirty fresh-frozen functional spinal units from 19 donors, aged between 43 and 75 years, including all segmental levels from T1-T2 to T11-T12, were loaded up to 7.5 Nm in flexion/extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. During loading, the IDP was measured using a flexible sensor tube, which was inserted into the nucleus pulposus under x-ray control. Pressure values were evaluated from third full loading cycles at 0.0, 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 Nm in each motion direction. Highest IDP increase was found in flexion, being significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) increased compared to extension IDP.

Flexion IDP was significantly increased in the upper compared to the mid- and lower thoracic spine, whereas extension IDP was significantly higher in the lower compared to the upper thoracic spine, both showing significant (<i>p</i> < 0.01) linear correlation with the segmental level at 7.5 Nm (flexion: <i>r</i> = -0.629, extension: <i>r</i> = 0.500). No significant effects of sex or age were detected, however trends toward higher IDP in specimens from female donors and decreasing IDP with increasing age, potentially caused by fibrotic degenerative changes in the nucleus pulposus tissue.

This experiment included three treatment groups: hypoxia, mid-hypoxia, and normoxia, in four replicates (four tanks per treatment) with the following dissolved oxygen levels: 3, 4, and >7 mg O<sub>2</sub>/L, respectively. At the end (2 weeks) and in the middle (1 week) of the experiment, fish from each tank were sampled for body measurements and molecular biology analysis. The results showed no differences in survival (∼90%) between treatment groups. Oxygen concentration was lowered to 3.02 ± 0.15 (mean ± SE) mg O<sub>2</sub>/L with no adverse effect on fish survival. The highest growth rate was observed in the normoxic group. A similar trend was observed with fish body length. The growth rate of fish declined with decreasing water-dissolved oxygen. The number of HIF-1α mRNA copies was not significantly different between hypoxic, mid-hypoxic, and normoxic conditions, and this was true for fish obtained in the middle and at the end of the experiment.

Concerns remain that such procedures can ""overconstrain"" (overreduce the lateral clavicle in relation to the acromion to a nonphysiological position) the joint. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to investigate the intra-articular pressure of native and reconstructed acromioclavicular (AC) joints in relation to the configuration of the joint. Anatomic (0 mm), overconstrained (-3 mm), and underconstrained (+3 mm) AC joint reconstructions were simulated. The hypothesis was that reconstructions using suture pulley systems do not increase the intra-articular pressure of the AC joint."
