    "Anchored CorEx is an extension of CorEx that allows the \"anchoring\" of words to topics. When anchoring a word to a topic, CorEx is trying to maximize the mutual information between that word and the anchored topic. So, anchoring provides a way to guide the topic model towards specific subsets of words that the user would like to explore.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The anchoring mechanism is flexible, and so there are many possibilities of anchoring. We explored the following types of anchoring in our TACL paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Anchoring a single set of words to a single topic. This can help promote a topic that did not naturally emerge when running an unsupervised instance of the CorEx topic model. For example, one might anchor words like \"snow,\" \"cold,\" and \"avalanche\" to a topic if one suspects there should be a snow avalanche topic within a set of disaster relief articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Anchoring single sets of words to multiple topics. This can help find different aspects of a topic that may be discussed in several different contexts. For example, one might anchor \"protest\" to three topics and \"riot\" to three other topics to understand different framings that arise from tweets about political protests.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Anchoring different sets of words to multiple topics. This can help enforce topic separability if there appear to be chimera topics. For example, one might anchor \"mountain,\" \"Bernese,\" and \"dog\" to one topic and \"mountain,\" \"rocky,\" and \"colorado\" to another topic to help separate topics that merge discussion of Bernese Mountain Dogs and the Rocky Mountains.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll demonstrate how to anchor words to the the CorEx topic model and how to develop other anchoring strategies."

    "**Choosing anchor strength:** the anchor strength controls how much weight CorEx puts towards maximizing the mutual information between the anchor words and their respective topics. Anchor strength should always be set at a value *greater than* 1, since setting anchor strength between 0 and 1 only recovers the unsupervised CorEx objective. Empirically, setting anchor strength from 1.5-3 seems to nudge the topic model towards the anchor words. Setting anchor strength greater than 5 is strongly enforcing that the CorEx topic model find a topic associated with the anchor words.\n",

    "Our TACL paper details the theory of the CorEx topic model, its sparsity optimization, anchoring via the information bottleneck, comparisons to LDA, and anchoring experiments. The two papers from Greg Ver Steeg and Aram Galstyan develop the CorEx theory in general and provide further motivation and details of the underlying CorEx mechanisms. Hodas et al. demonstrated early CorEx topic model results and investigated an application of pointwise total correlations to quantify \"surprising\" documents.\n",
